london to izmir via istanbul first time id flown tk i found them very good in the air cabin crew planes food all very nice not so great on the ground ground staff call centre computer systems my flight from lhr was delayed so i missed the connection in istanbul most ground staff dont speak english and i was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little english i eventually got on a flight to izmir three hours later but it wasnt an easy process made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport also id phoned a tk call centre based in ukraine to pay an extra or so each way for extra leg room seats however as the departure times kept changing my seats kept changing and for the return leg to london from istanbul i was not given an extra leg room seat luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out overall i think their cabin crew and planes are very good ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with,"[{'span': 'air cabin crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'ground ground staff call centre computer', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'ground staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'tk call centre', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'cabin crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'cabin crew', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'planes', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'ground staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'call centre staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

rome to prishtina via istanbul i flew with this company several times in the past years and i can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse i flew from rome to prishtina via istanbul all flights had a delay which apparently is pretty normal with turkish the ground staff is for the most part useless in istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay i had just minutes before the connecting flight and the whole answer was relax sir no problem sir its okay the new airport is a gigantic mess very big and disorganized when you land in istanbul it takes about to minutes taxiing and other minutes before they actually start disembarking its an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry forget about asking for some indication at the new airport they all chat between each other some with a coffee in their hands i flew with four different aircraft on this trip two were fairly new the other two were old seats worn food on board was of very poor quality let me repeat this verypoor quality in general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try of course it is far from the experience you get flying qatar or emirates but still pretty good while ground personnel especially in istanbul is the personification of the word lazy a complete disaster i will try and avoid turkish airlines in the future it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay if you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs,"[{'span': 'ground staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'coffee', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'crew', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'ground personnel', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
flew on turkish airlines iad-ist-khi and return khi-ist-iad turkish airlines has consistently maintained its quality since i first flew with them in the flights leave on time the catering is excellent the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use and the cabin crew is excellent interesting though the a on the khi-ist route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the a on the iad-ist route which was showing its age the a on the iad-ist route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight but turkish airlines will be replacing the a on its flight to iad with the sometime in the summer turkish food was served on the return leg which i personally like and i saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice overall another wonderful experience with turkish airlines,"[{'span': 'catering', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'entertainment', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'cabin crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'leg room', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'entertainment', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'cabin staff', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'lavatory', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

the experience with turkish airlines has been devastating one first paid euros per luggage totaling euros for luggage that end up lost between turkish airlines and jetblue my itinerary was from venice to istanbul to boston and from there with jetblue to san juan puerto rico once i made it to boston i looked for my luggage and it never made it to bos i immediately try to make a reclamation to turkish airlines at bos and was told that i had to wait until my final destination once i made it to my final destination i made my claim turkish airlines will not cooperate with jetblue and even if jb was really trying to help is not much they could do because taturkish airlines did not care for my luggage it never made to boston turkish airlines have been unhelpful in my case even presenting evidence to both airlines neither is able to find my lost claim luggage it seems the claim is a form which after being submitted it get to be submitted evidence dead word as they do not even comply with the search of the lost not delivered luggage in hands of turkish airlines,"[{'span': 'luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'jetblue', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'jetblue', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'jetblue', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'claim luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
not verified new york to erbil via istanbul they have the worst customer service my initial leg was delayed due to weather so i was going to miss my connection turkish airlines did nothing to help - in fact finding someone with turkish airlines to assist is a feat in itself ta kept passing the blame bottom line - if any segment of your turkish airlines flights causes a delay then you are sol when it comes to ta plan on spending a lot more money and flying another airline because turkish airlines will not assist you and they will keep your money the customer service is a joke - they read from scripts and keep repeating the same paragraph - almost like robots they also tell you to send an email - it is just a stalling tactic,"[{'span': 'customer service', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'customer service', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
tehran to new york via istanbul terrible experience and terrible customer service! will never fly again i tried to change my flight date called the airline and they made the changes told me i would be getting a confirmation email after i hang up never received it i called back submitted my request again and was told that someone would get back to me in at most days never happened again i called back this was days to the actual flight date was told i need to go to a airline office to make a change! the closest office to me is miles away also there was a schedule change on the ticket that i did not confirm when i called i was told that i would not get charged the penalty i ended up getting chargedthe fare difference almost in addition to the trip cost for a one way trip so this has never happened before with any other airline it would have been easier to cancel and buy a new flight which would have cost me around for a two way,[]
belgrade to athens via istanbul my first flight departed with delay from belgrade due to local weather conditions in istanbul i requested for a connection assistance in order to catch my second flight but the airline did not provide me such assistance i managed to arrive at the gate of departure of my second flight while boarding was not completed and while the screen mentioned last call but i was denied boarding because the system had unchecked me from the second flight due to late arrival of my previous plane people were boarding in front of my eyes on the plane the turkish airlines officer deceivingly told me to go to another gate because another plane was waiting for me he just got rid of me gate was near the rebooking office of turkish airlines for the issuance of new tickets although i was condemned to stay overnight at the airport i was not proposed hotel accommodation or a meal i was put on another flight departing next morning without even offered the possibility to select my checked seat the officer rejected my request for an aisle position despite the fact that the plane was half-empty! i filled a complaint form for denial of boarding and they replied that they are not responsible for a flight delay due to weather conditions turkish airlines maybe is a large company but it manages these type of routine problems poorly as a low budget airline,"[{'span': 'meal', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
dublin to tel aviv via stanbul first of all our flight was delayed for over an hour but thats fine we crossed that bridge then when we arrived in stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from turkish airlines and not from different companies ok minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from stanbul to tel aviv not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something arriving in tel aviv we found our bags on the belt but so called oversized bag which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter was missing almost hours waiting for it to be found no luck then another half an hour of registering with lostfound made us exhausted myself my husband and kids aged and at am in the morning is no fun at all we supposed to pick up our rental car in between -am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late we had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available i think turkish airlines should be liable for that as well we registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to eilat for a few days i was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details i was days later arriving back to tel aviv and with no contact from lostfound i rang them to see whats the story and i was shocked when i heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! where when to who the answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! how come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me answer was delivery company rang you but there was no answer left a message i doubt it i think its pure lies anyway i said i want my baggage back please get it to me! oh you know it might take couple of days fine i said just get it please! few days later i rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that theres no such person registered but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there again i was promised that few days later i will get it as you can imagine i didnt rang again today asked for the manager was told the manager is in holiday got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in eilat but in airport eilat and because its holiday pesah the airport is closed and they cant get it and she said you know its your fault that it went to eilat when i asked her name she refused to give and hanged up on me,"[{'span': 'customer service', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'bag', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'car', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'car', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'car', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'delivery company', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'delivery man', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"
houston to kiev via istanbul fares seem competitive but there is a catch in terms of layover time mine from houston to kiev via istanbul had a return leg layover of hours and though tk website says that a layover of over a certain hours gets a complimentary hotel stay but there is a fine print somewhere which they always get a disqualified citing some wired rules that i even as a frequent traveler cannot comprehend another notable difference in turkey is that there are endless and multiple security checks and one wonders if one is going through a war zone lines at security checks and passport control yes if you need to stay at a hotel for a long layover one needs to get an e-visa just to get out check into a hotel and get back to airport to catch the connecting flight ended up paying way more than if i had chosen other airlines like lh or sas which i will keep in mind next time,[]
tashkent to istanbul a poor experience with turkish airlines the guy who seemed to be the cabin chief was acting in a very extremely rude way towards the passengers almost yelling at them mostly hurrying people to sit down quickly very unprofessional the tightest space for seating i experienced apart from a low cost carrier in indonesia a mess with luggage clearly too many volumes allowed onboard,"[{'span': 'cabin chief', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'luggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

not verified mumbai to istanbul one of the worst experiences of our life has been this trip on turkish airlines after booking a confirmed flight on th april we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves days earlier than we land thankfully we didnt select this by mistake then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at istanbul we were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend usd on an express visa to enter turkey plus an additional usd on travel the airline doesnt give you rooms in the airport which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and turkish wont pay for it to make matters worse today the check in doesnt work and theyve told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats avoid this airline for its terrible customer service,[]

montreal to berlin via istanbul i was mostly disappointed with the services i flew from montreal to istanbul and from the beginning i felt the experience to be flawed there were some business class seats and i had chosen a seat with direct aisle access the seat is quite comfortable and large was what i noticed at first the cabin crew was awful they congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in as we were in the middle of winter passengers all had heavy winter coats i was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats i was a bit taken aback by the crews response no later later needless to say i was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat the crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbours at any time during this hour flight we sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered no water bottle for at least minutes the crew came by after minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages i declined the drink and was asked if i wanted anything else and i ordered champagne all drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and i thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in canada even on low cost carriers! menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on after take off the service was not well planned it took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! we had just left montreal at pm and i suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! i declined the offer for bedding and informed they that i would be ready for it after dinner of course sir anything you want the response lacked being genuine and i felt the crew was somewhat irked the service began with handling out a bottle of water minutes into the flight we waited another or so minutes and we were asked for drinks the onboard chef came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way he would take the order for - seats at a time and then disappear the whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken minutes the food was served and it was beautifully plated i cant say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier ive flown in business class the onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and i could not really see how he was a chef he took our order chefs dont usually do this and made sure the plates looked nice i think that is the extent of it and i dont really see any exotic or added value to thisduring the whole meal my drinks went dry for or more minutes at a time i have flown many carriers in business class and i have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal the crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive i also experienced the turkish airlines lounge in istanbul during my connection it is tired looking and circus like atmosphere i qualified for the use of a resting suite the attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when i could shower i was there hours and she never came,"[{'span': 'cabin crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'bar', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'crew', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'crew members', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'crew member', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'dinner', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'crew', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'chef', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'food order', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'onboard chef', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'chef', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'meal', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'meal', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'attendant', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

i am flying from vienna to singapore with a layover in istanbul for hours i selected this long layover knowing that i had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the sunday pm free tour around the city that turkish airlines provides to its travelers when they have long wait at the airport prior my flight i confirmed via phone with turkish airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as person would like to make the tour that would be sufficient to do it and that i needed to be at hotel desk min before the start as soon as we landed i rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about minutes and i arrived at the desk at pm min later than expected although i was late i did see that the tour group was there with the guide getting ready to leave i asked at the desk if i could join and they told me no tour is finished i was not going to take no for an answer as i had chosen turkish airlines and a hours layover flight instead of to jump on that tour the manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full she said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me in the website clearly states that as long as person will be interested in the tour it will be arranged according to her excuse she had people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take it is interesting to say the least that apparently i was so unlucky that i was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of people it is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was when it looked more like people this person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative all she did was to yell at me and say that if i was not happy that i should open a claim so thats what im doing now i would like to highlight that all i wanted was to do the tour on my way to singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen instead now i want a compensation,[]

not verified amsterdam via istanbul to havana return im really satisfied with the overall performance of thy the seat pitch is quite good a lot of choices and a very good responsive personal entertainment system the food is really good and the quantity of the food they offered you is certainly enough you receive an amenity kit on the long haul flight which is a nice touch there is live television and wifi on board but the wifi was quite expensive the live television worked perfect i could watch a live soccer match! downside is that the crew sometimes a bit tired looks and act the layover in istanbul is a bit chaotic my bags arrived in havana and also on the way back in amsterdam my conclusion is that turkish airlines offers a good product when you compare it with the price i would choose them again and can recommend them,"[{'span': 'entertainment system', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'amenity kit', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'television', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'wifi', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'wifi', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'television', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'soccer match', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"

amsterdam to ankara via istanbul turkish airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this ife screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for times and i could only start a movie near the end of the flight and i could not finish of course although not perfect cabin service is good but ground service is undeniably terrible i barely could catch my transit flight after a very long chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of ataturk airport to the other many airlines mostly from asia set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes turkish into a way lower tier for such treats i would not pay a dime extra for business and straightly prefer economy class with this airlines especially for short and mid hauls,[]
istanbul to beirut my flight with turkish airlines was my worst experience ever we were a group of people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline to start with we arrived about hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport we had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion noting that not all counters were available then the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak english so we had many difficulties to understand what they want how come that an international airport has only turkish speaking staff and rude staff next we went to check in with tax refund process and here in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world they need to check your baggage you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped what a shame we got delayed due to this process but still we were safe and on time due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items we lost a cell phone we were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost we lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate mins earlier after running miles and miles to reach our gate after mins of running the staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended mins ago we had to buy new tickets even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time concerning turkish airlines we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket so we bought new tickets for all of us also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of turkish airlines and by the sales office of turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket however our bags arrived to beirut with the flight that we missed and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in turkey till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in beirut who managed to take them from beirut international airport this was my worst flight ever i didnt receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the turkish airline staff but i was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight this flight and this airport is never to be recommended,"[{'span': 'passport control', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'airline staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

istanbul to neveshir this is a follow-up to my review first posted on rd sept well as it turns out first impressions didnt quite last any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well simple procedure right not with turkish while even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent pir property irregularity report they couldnt we went to the lost found offices of airports in turkey - istanbul kayseri and nevsehir all of them got us to contact a different department bla bla bla basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world when the baggage finally arrived at our hotel it was an hour delay thats normal what wasnt normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! the handling company said that we are a third party engaged by the airline and there was nothing to sign! while outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival so the story continues when we finally managed to get our hands on a pir it was a computer generated one with no letterhead no company stamp and no signature a -year old could have reproduced the same document using ms word most importantly it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival how is any insurance company going to process a claim if a pir does not state the time of baggage arrival so now we are going around the world from one department to another to yet another again just to get our hands on a proper pir case is not yet closed,"[{'span': 'baggage arrival', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'property irregularity report', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'courier companies', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage arrival', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage arrival', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'insurance company', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'baggage arrival', 'polarity': 'negative'}]"

manchester to ercan via istanbul check in at manchester was fast and efficient in business class the reason for that would become apparent later plane was due to depart at but when we went to the gate as advised the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused eventually we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves plane left minutes late and the service during the flight was as to be expected superb food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section the cabin crew were very good because of the delay we were short of time in istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security the flight from istanbul to ercan was aboard a a with the seating layout boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport the flight was only hour minutes so it was not too bad but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin the seats were not particularly comfortable and the seat adjust buttons did not seem to work the meal on this flight was superb the flight attendants were efficient and did their best on this short flight,"[{'span': 'staff', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'food', 'polarity': 'neutral'}, {'span': 'cabin crew', 'polarity': 'positive'}, {'span': 'security', 'polarity': 'negative'}, {'span': 'meal', 'polarity': 'positive'}]"
