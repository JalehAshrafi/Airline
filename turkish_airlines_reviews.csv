Turkish Airlines,7.0,Christopher Hackley,8th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Izmir via Istanbul. First time Iâ€™d flown TK. I found them very good in the air, cabin crew, planes, food, all very nice. Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff donâ€™t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasnâ€™t an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, Iâ€™d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.",,Business,Economy Class,London to Izmir via Istanbul,2019-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,yes,london to izmir via istanbul first time id flown tk i found them very good in the air cabin crew planes food all very nice not so great on the ground ground staff call centre computer systems my flight from lhr was delayed so i missed the connection in istanbul most ground staff dont speak english and i was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little english i eventually got on a flight to izmir three hours later but it wasnt an easy process made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport also id phoned a tk call centre based in ukraine to pay an extra or so each way for extra leg room seats however as the departure times kept changing my seats kept changing and for the return leg to london from istanbul i was not given an extra leg room seat luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out overall i think their cabin crew and planes are very good ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with

Turkish Airlines,3.0,M Galerko,7th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: ""Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It's okay"". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,Zeshan Shah,6th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew on Turkish Airlines IAD-IST-KHI and return KHI-IST-IAD. Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice.

My initial leg was delayed due to weather so I was going to miss my connection. Turkish Airlines did nothing to help - in fact finding someone with Turkish Airlines to assist is a feat in itself.

People were boarding in front of my eyes on the plane. The Turkish Airlines officer deceivingly told me to go to another gate (215) because another plane was waiting for me. He just got rid of me.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Vlad Perepichka,25th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Tel Aviv via Ä°stanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but thatâ€™s fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in Ä°stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see whatâ€™s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think itâ€™s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that thereâ€™s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didnâ€™t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because itâ€™s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they canâ€™t get it.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,S Raesen,2nd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization. Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Tomas Gubas,2nd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the ""great"" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule.

TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant, tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Andrei Muravev,20th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I bought and paid tickets 3 months before departure. I had pre-selected certain seats convenient to us. I am a self-moving disabled person. I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada â€“ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€ The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways!

Turkish Airlines,1.0,A Bayur,1st March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I along with my 6.5-month-old son were traveling from London to Kabul via Istanbul. The flight from London got delayed. When I arrived at Istanbul I couldn't find my son's pushchair which was supposed to be next to the aircraft. I had to jump on the bus to get to the next flight but when I arrived that was gone. I was only booked on the next flight leaving 24 hours later. I was not offered any accommodation or any facilities to help me care for my baby. Even the pushchair was not brought to me so at least the little one could sleep.

In light of all this, my son and I suffered very much and it wasn't even our fault. Please avoid this airline they are the worst people to fly with.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Julie Fry,24th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,K Leng,21st February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasnâ€™t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasnâ€™t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, Iâ€™ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything thatâ€™s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlinesâ€™ fault and that they didnâ€™t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. Iâ€™ve tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time Iâ€™ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me theyâ€™ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but itâ€™s been 2 months now and I havenâ€™t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didnâ€™t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that theyâ€™ll fully refund me, but arenâ€™t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what Iâ€™ve been through. Itâ€™s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews).

Turkish Airlines,4.0,T Barlin,20th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",A330 / A321,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul,February 2019,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,montreal to berlin via istanbul i was mostly disappointed with the services i flew from montreal to istanbul and from the beginning i felt the experience to be flawed there were some business class seats and i had chosen a seat with direct aisle access the seat is quite comfortable and large was what i noticed at first the cabin crew was awful they congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in as we were in the middle of winter passengers all had heavy winter coats i was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats i was a bit taken aback by the crews response no later later needless to say i was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat the crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbours at any time during this hour flight we sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered no water bottle for at least minutes the crew came by after minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages i declined the drink and was asked if i wanted anything else and i ordered champagne all drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and i thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in canada even on low cost carriers! menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on after take off the service was not well planned it took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! we had just left montreal at pm and i suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! i declined the offer for bedding and informed they that i would be ready for it after dinner of course sir anything you want the response lacked being genuine and i felt the crew was somewhat irked the service began with handling out a bottle of water minutes into the flight we waited another or so minutes and we were asked for drinks the onboard chef came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way he would take the order for - seats at a time and then disappear the whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken minutes the food was served and it was beautifully plated i cant say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier ive flown in business class the onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and i could not really see how he was a chef he took our order chefs dont usually do this and made sure the plates looked nice i think that is the extent of it and i dont really see any exotic or added value to thisduring the whole meal my drinks went dry for or more minutes at a time i have flown many carriers in business class and i have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal the crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive i also experienced the turkish airlines lounge in istanbul during my connection it is tired looking and circus like atmosphere i qualified for the use of a resting suite the attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when i could shower i was there hours and she never came

Turkish Airlines,1.0,K Darzane,17th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the â€œTransferâ€ station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they donâ€™t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wifeâ€™s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers.

It's not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it's far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.)

The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Afif Ibrahim,12th February 2019,"Not Verified | Vienna to Istanbul. Our morning flight was delayed then eventually cancelled due to the bad weather which is understandable. We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,E Maysan,12th February 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to London. On our flight back from Istanbul we handed our baby stroller to Turkish Airlines. When we arrived to London we realized that the stroller was damaged. We started a claim case there at Heathrow airport. An online account was opened for us through which we filled in more information and received an evaluation which said that that THY would compensate the repair. We ordered two pieces of replacement covers and sent the receipts to THY. This was on the 19th of January. Since then we've been trying to resolve the case but we are being ignored. Today I talked to customer service for the 5th time. Every time I'm told that we should hear back in couple days but we never do. This is such a shame. What we claim is not even that much.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,G Larina,10th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to itÂ´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,H Mazaresh,18th January 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Frederick Lansky,17th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu.

At this point I could no longer wait, and had to fly back to Berlin. My original return would have been the day before.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Thea Hallak,22nd December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100â‚¬ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360â‚¬ per person to 680â‚¬ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut.

They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and thatâ€™s Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me itâ€™ll be 45 min and they canâ€™t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something donâ€™t leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldnâ€™t care.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,T Merter,8th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines needs to offer transfer service options (maybe even check in at pick up location) like Emirates does if it wants to remain competitive as the current arrangements for the new Istanbul Airport are greatly inadequate. The check-in kiosks are still not operating reliably. TGS staff were present to offer assistance. However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities. Boarding conducted in a orderly manner and on-time departure. The 2Ã—2 seating business class product on this fairly new 737-800 is as good as it gets with IFE and ample space.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Robert Pierce,7th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines is the best domestic service and value within Europe. Turkish domestic flights across the board are quite cheap by EU and US standards, having paid $40 for a flight comparable to Boston-New York or London-Paris. Boarding was quite speedy and orderly, and what a treat to be on an enormous long-haul aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER on such a short route, really feels special. Legroom and seat width are stellar by domestic or international standards, with a very neat and clean appearance. Inflight entertainment was not activated for this roughly hour-long journey, but a standard Turkish-style warm cheese sandwich was provided, the quality of which rivals $9 buy on board options in the USA. Cabin crew, of course, were professional and quick but not rushed. Arrival into Izmir was smooth, and we arrived at an actual gate, as opposed to needing to take a bus from a remote stand.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Reem Abdalla,5th December 2018,"Not Verified | Toronto to Cairo via Istanbul. Worst experience ever. On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just donâ€™t take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service. All I wanted from them was to give exact and clear information on what can be done to deal with them being late. Instead, they just let us wander around and wasted Everyoneâ€™s time.

Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FAâ€™s went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as â€œPriorityâ€ my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,T Eldem,30th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FAâ€™s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FAâ€™s do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Christelle Nasrany,24th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Stephen Brunette,21st November 2018,"Not Verified | I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadn't flown Turkish in 4 years, and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777, even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual, not enough gates at Ataturk airport, and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Murat Polat,17th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Montreal. The boarding process was interesting. Firstly, you cannot do online check-in as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Benedict Jones,12th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them.

We had to take this option as we had to be there on time for my mothers funeral. When I went to the Turkish Airlines office in Turkey after 10 days, they told me I cannot get a refund because I already used my ticket. I told them this is what the customer service told me, and the reply is ""There is nothing we can do"". But it was the Turkish Airlines representative who persuaded us not to cancel our flights and change them instead.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Lim,26th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR.

Two weeks before departure we were advised that the flight to Istanbul Nairobi had been anticipated and that therefore we would have had only one hour of call but that we would have done it easily (before confirming the acceptance of the flight change, we talked with the customer service Turkish who gave us confirmation - I hope that the phone calls are recorded, as well as an email in which we confirmed that we would have made it). As expected, the flight from Venice to Istanbul leaves late. We get off the plane at 18.05. The flight to Nairobi would leave at 18.40 but already on the panel appeared written ""gate closed"". We go to the gate and at 18.15 we are there the flight was due to leave at 18.40) and the gate is actually closed and the plane has already left. They send us to a desk for customer support that is not the right one and we find out after 10 minutes of waiting thanks to another customer who warns us. After having gone through 3 Turkish desk (Ataturk airport is not really small ...) we arrive at the correct one where in an absolutely rude manner they warn us that we would have to wait 24 hours for the next plane.

They make us get on a bus without telling us where we were going and leave us in a hotel near the airport ... no ifs and buts, without even the foresight to say: sorry in the center was all full.

We requested mobility assistance and the customer service reassured us that it is already fixed. When we arrived in Istanbul airport, the flight crew who assisted me get off the plane just left us without any explanation or instruction. We were clueless where should we go and where should we wait. When we asked an airport staff, he just told us in a rude manner to stay where we are and wait for the assistance for the next flight. We were so unsure and worried so we asked again a ground crew if there is an assistance coming to help me. I am handicapped and cannot walk so we really need this assistance.

Food was decent, and entertainment was also pretty good. However the one thing that Turkish Airlines is really poor on is transit flight. The airport staff are slow, very ruthless and have no courtesy at all. You may say this is the airport's fault, but this was mainly seen from Turkish Airlines staff. The staff on my flight were a bit rude, and when you asked for something to drink, you would need to ask repeatedly as they wouldn't bring you a drink. Anyways, our flight was delayed from Istanbul. No surprise. Made us feel like we were flying on a really bad airline and especially due to the delays at both Dhaka and Istanbul. We landed at London, only to find out that half of the plane's luggage did not arrive. All the transit flight luggage were missing and consequently delayed. It's now been 6 days since I've flown, and I have not received some of the luggage. It's appalling especially when its with an airline you have huge expectations for.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,T. Eldem,9th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Prague on Turkish Airlines. Following a smooth check-in processed by a helpful and pleasant agent we made our way to the lounge. The lounge was crowded but there was ample space compared to the cramped, noisy and hot main terminal. Istanbul airport is a nightmare unless you have access to the Turkish Airlines lounge. After a few beverages and snacks we made our way to the gate. Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FAâ€™s was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline. They are rude, unprofessional and have extremely poor language skills.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Shaun Casey,2nd September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. Itâ€™s the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that Iâ€™ve ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. Iâ€™m amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it canâ€™t even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Jens Jorgensen,30th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Billund to Bangkok via Istanbul. Beside the very short connection in Istanbul that caused me had to run for the next flight, it was a quite good experience. It started with a friendly checkin staff that moved us to the emergency exit row so I had plenty of legroom for my 190cm. Service onboard was good with nice meal for a 3h flight, and crew was a very friendly. The only issue was that they was that they didn't provide gate info for the next flight from Istanbul and our 55 minutes layover was only 40min because of delay on first flight, so we had to run for the most remote gate. Flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was older B777 with 3-3-3 config, with legroom thais equal to Emirates B777 but wider seats. IFE not at the same level as Emirates and old screen.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Fiona Cumbo,30th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | A disappointing start to our family holiday of a lifetime! Shocking customer service. No communication. Rude, aggressive and miserable staff. Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick â€“ Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldnâ€™t tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldnâ€™t go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didnâ€™t think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying.

I had very little time to board as standby and they held me up for ages over checking my carry-on because a group of them rudely pointed out to me there was no way it qualified as a carry on. (It had on Delta, however). Extremely unprofessional as a group of them stood behind the counter talking and laughing about me while I was paying to check my now extra bag. They were so cold and unable to empathize, that for that experience alone I would never willfully fly Turkish Airlines again. On the flight I pressed the call button twice because I never had time to grab water and the small glass they give you a couple times isnâ€™t enough for an 11 hour flight. My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out. When passengers were up and confused about the direction of where to go they were curtly told â€œyou canâ€™t pass through hereâ€ and then ignored. No smile, nothing.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Murat Polat,21st August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | The plane was a fairly new A330-300 (TC-JOF, first flew in 2015). Boarding a Turkish flight used to be a challenge, but not this time. They divided us into business, economy row 27 which worked really well. Standard Turkish Airlines economy cabin, the seat itself not very comfortable, okay legroom. Not better or worse than any other economy seat on a wide-body plane. I usually love the food on Turkish Airlines, both quality and quantity-wise. However this time, the food wasn't as good as it used to be, especially the rice. (It hasn't been that long since I last flew Turkish). Quantity-wise it was fine, we got served dinner, snacks and a breakfast. The crew, on the other hand, was outstanding. Way better than any other TK flight I've taken. They were really nice and helpful, and actually wanted to talk to people! There were plenty of new films on the IFE system. I usually don't watch any films on the IFE, but I watched 4 films this time! We departed on time and actually landed early (I think they do it in case they need to fly around IST before landing).

Turkish Airlines,3.0,C Lan,20th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Dubai. My flight was at 12:30am, and I was off to the airport by 8pm. Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didnâ€™t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, itâ€™s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to itâ€™s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldnâ€™t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldnâ€™t even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers. I will never ever fly them again - hell they are not even the cheapest, just spend that few extra hundred to be on Emirates or other more reputable airline.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ofer Yitzhak,19th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. For some reason the flight to Istanbul was delayed in about 25 minutes so instead of 75 minutes I only had 50 minutes for the connection. Once landed crew called all passengers to Tel Aviv to hurry up (a delay that was caused because of you), now obviously I was in a hurry and thought it's good that they are aware of the problem and since operating both flights probably leave the gate open a few more minutes. I got to the gate and they just closed it, the ground crew was still there and had last passengers on the jet bridge. Frustrating as it was seeing the plane just standing there for about half hour and the only thing separating me from getting back to my mother's funeral on time was a door. I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I'm not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight. The answer I got is: ""Lounge is only for business passengers"" so I'm not allowed to go there and I can use one of the restaurant's free wi-fi (obviously didnâ€™t work). So had to wait 5 hours for the next flight feeling like nobody cares and really trying to help me. It was not just one of your employees, I spoke to about 8 different people trying to explain my situation and they all kept sending me back and forth until I realized they are just trying to get rid of me.

I used to be a fan of Turkish Airlines, flew them several time and rarely had an issue - but that was about 2 years ago! Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage. And cherry on the cake, I've been stuck at home all day waiting for them to deliver my suitcases (were supposed to do it from 1pm to 6pm, then from 6pm to 8pm - it's 8:43pm and still nothing). I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet.

When I got to Kenya, my bags didnâ€™t make it. There were many other people in the same situation, as there was a big line up at their counter. After waiting for at least an hour, the agent told me the bags were in Turkey and that they would be delivered sometime in the next 2 days. Iâ€™m lucky I had some spare clothes in my carry-on. I called Turkish everyday ever since and just yesterday (July 4th) they told me they basically have no idea where my 2 suitcases are. All agents are very unhelpful and have no idea what is going on. I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didnâ€™t even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,mark durbridge,2nd July 2018,"Not Verified | Istanbul to Manila. Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Lucy Foo Yong How,28th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flight-time 20:05 as the check-in time for 22:05. After a two-week holiday, my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror, I discovered that the gate was closed! And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport. On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,C Lethino,27th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,F James,21st June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | The aircraft was modern with excellent inflight entertainment options (latest movies were available). Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations.

Before boarding the plane, I chose to have my seats near the exits as I was 6 months pregnant. However, when I boarded the plane, I was told by the guy sitting next to me that I was not supposed to be seated beside him as he told the air steward that he wanted my seat for him and his son. I sat down anyway, as I was not told of it. 5 mins later, the air steward told me to change my seats to accommodate the father and son, and I was moved all the way to the back of the plane. Best part, I have requested for special meals to be served, however, they did not update my special meal request even when they were the one who forced me to have my seats changed.

Check-in at Turkish counter in Miami was very smooth and quick. The boarding process was done by letters and was very without issues. Onboard I was impressed with the cleanliness of the aircraft and how new it was (no more than 3-5 years old). The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well. Flight was operated with an A330-200 which I found odd for such a short leg. Very clean plane, relatively new and same great entertainment system. Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Paul Neelman,8th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didnâ€™t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Stasia Buffenbarger,28th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Munich via Istanbul. Do not fly with Turkish Airlines, especially if you fly coach. The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don't call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5'11"" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5'4"" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston, but because of the time difference, it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number, +90 212 444 08 492, and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved, but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that, she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats, I approved releasing the seats - and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone.

We had 1 hour and 45 mins delay from Antalya to Istanbul causing us to miss our connecting flight to London. We had not missed the flight completely but as we got to the gate the airport security said they cannot let us board the plane as Turkish Airlines have stop anyone from boarding 15 mins prior to take off. I spoke to the management in Antalya in regards to a possibility of missing our connection flight at the rate the delay was going. The staff was so calm and collective to say its all fine, you will be on the flight without issue. Bear in mind, hardly any of Turkish airlines staff on ground level can speak fluent English!. I wasn't to assured by his statement. No one in the Airport was helpful and wished to direct or instruct us in what can be done etc. These guys have no customer service or communication skills whatsoever. Just for a few mins of lack of management caused me and my family to wait another 12 hours for the next flight with no consideration about children at all.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,C Larnoute,17th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | On a recent â€˜round-tripâ€™ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didnâ€™t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,R Stayle,16th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. Iâ€™m a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this wonâ€™t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Ashwin Swar,15th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through.

I fly to Asia on business 5-6 times a year and Turkish Airlines has always been my preferred airline. Until I got stuck for two days at IST airport during the military coup 2 years ago. But that's a different story altogether. I now tried Turkish Airlines again on a business trip to Singapore and could not believe how much the airline has changed to the worse.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Hein Hillmer,25th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I recently flew Turkish Airlines (to/from South Africa via Istanbul), and upon boarding my return flight Johannesburg to Houston via Istanbul and due to their gate security not recognizing my paperwork, I was denied entry onto my flight. Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, â€œthere is a phone and computer, google your help.â€ I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person.

When we reached Istanbul, the plane taxied away and a bus brought us to the terminal. Entrance to terminal was jam packed with passengers from other flights. It took us 20 minutes to make us inside the terminal. Next the international transfer security check was overwhelmed with passengers. I tried talking to the staff to let me go first but they said stay where you are in the lane - all passengers say that same things to go first. As a result I missed my connection. I went to the transfer desk for Turkish Airline. The lady said he will get me fixed on the next flight that leaves in three hours. She said I should wait while she gets a new boarding pass. I waited and waited. Followed up 5 times. Each time I was told not to worry and its being done. After 3 hours - a gentleman from Turkish Airways told me that it was my fault that I missed the connection. 1 hour was more than enough to get the connection. I explained to him the reasons but he said still fault is mine! I asked him if this is what the case is than why I was made to wait for 3 hours?

Almost without fail, each time I asked for a drink ""full of ice"" and motioned with my hands to show a glass brimming with ice, I got a drink without any ice at all. Other interactions with crew were found to be lacking given low English proficiency. The cockpit announcement on the IST-VIE sector was almost completely unintelligible. Food was fairly good, but no better than QR or a number of other carriers. On the return, IST-IAD, a very rude passenger in 3E (I was in 4K) began berating me when I dared to use the overhead bin above his seat which was directly across from my seat. All other bins were full with either bedding for the sleep service or other pax's luggage.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,H Steivel,8th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some donâ€™t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600â‚¬ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didnâ€™t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just donâ€™t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They donâ€™t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They donâ€™t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, thatâ€™s just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,T Eldem,7th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Beijing to Istanbul. TK uses a third party to handle their ground formalities in Beijing and need to be aware of the terribly rude and substandard service by check-in and gate agents. My check-in was processed by an agent who was abrupt and surly who conversed with a colleague throughout the check-in process. At the gate we were told there was a 30 minute delay although none of the monitors showed it. As with most departures in China boarding was chaotic with priority lanes being used by all passengers. The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airlineâ€™s fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,P Hamoulady,1st April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Tehran via Istanbul. I had one of my worst experience (if not the worst) with Turkish Airlines. I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with.

The business seats are side by side lie flats and not the more modern individual spaces found on most long-haul airlines. So, privacy is an issue.

However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,E Lamijula,7th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston. Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,B Vernon,4th March 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx Â£120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx Â£230 for my extra bag. Â£110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price?

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Mark Tonino,1st March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Guangzhou. One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,H Wazlan,26th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The first time I flew with Turkish Airlines and it was a disappointment. My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,E Halisha,25th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Tel Aviv to New York via Istanbul. Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,David Ellis,1st February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Derek Northcutt,31st January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to New York via Istanbul. Have always been satisfied with Turkish Airlines: good service, good food, good prices. However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel.

This delay meant a missed connection. There was no one from Turkish Airlines to help or assist. After visiting several counters, waiting for hours, I was given new boarding card for a flight 24 hours later. They did not provide any meal and when I asked for a hotel they made me pay for the visa. The next day they asked me to be ready to go to the airport but they did not come and pick me up. Hotel management contacted the airline and they said I should keep waiting. An hour before the flight time, I decided to take a taxi. Due to a flight delay, I managed to catch my flight.

Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course.

Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from. The only complaint I have is, that they do not come and ask or refill the drink you are enjoying.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Jean Pierre Barbe,25th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | It was my first time flying Turkish Airlines from Geneva to Jakarta via Istanbul. I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff donâ€™t even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it.

Our transit time at IST was around 14 hrs. When approached the service counter at Istanbul they gave us only one snack (one slice of pizza for each passenger) voucher. I asked her where to stay for full day transit. She said anywhere at the airport and went back to her mobile phone chat. In between, she was chatting with a male colleague and didn't seem to have time to pay attention to customer. She worked more like a machine than a human in only giving vouchers with out speaking to customers. Upon complaint they tried to cover its inefficiency and poor service by saying that â€œNo request can be traced at their hotel desk on ISTâ€. How will there be a record if TK staff misleads the customers away. Nobody (TK ticket sales office at Lahore airport) had informed us the time of ticketing to request a hotel in advance during transit at IST.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Rohith Jayawardene,15th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Rohith Jayawardene,15th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,R Joseph,12th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew business class, TK35 Istanbul to Montreal on Dec 08 2017. I must emphasize the amazing lounge in Istanbul. No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isnâ€™t Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lotâ€™s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Jonathan Williams,10th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada. It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: â€œReissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didnâ€™t see was the fine print at the bottom: â€œTurkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.â€. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered â€œI canâ€™t accept thisâ€. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Enda Ginting,2nd December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | My first flights (Jakarta to Antalya via Istanbul). On the homebound flight from Antalya to Jakarta via Istanbul my TK 2425 (30 Nov 2017) was delayed without any announcement. On boarding I asked the ground crew if I would still be able to catch my Istanbul-Jakarta flight (TK56), and the ground crew replied that ""no problem"". The plane landed late and I missed my flight to Jakarta. Yes, Turkish airline did give me a hotel, yes, Turkish airline did give me a ticket rebooking, yes Turkish airline did give me breakfast-lunch-dinner. However, I did not receive my luggage and hence I did not have any change of clothes. Upon seeing the queue at the Turkish Airlines hotel transfer I was in a dilemma of either waiting another 2 hours before getting my luggage at 4am or go sleep at the hotel and not have my luggage. In my luggage was also my laptop charger and mobile charger which I would have needed to inform work, arrangements that I will be delayed by one day. But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed. I was appalled by the ground crew at Antalya airport who lied to my face, and the ground crew at the hotel transfer who did not sympathize that I needed my luggage and only offered strict options. I was very dissapointed that Turkish airline did not provide me a letter of delay to help me justify my situation at my home country, and no laundry service hence I was not in fresh clothes for more than 48hrs!

Turkish Airlines,1.0,T Vincent,29th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Being a loyal customer of this airline, I was once again dissapointed with Turkish Airlines completely messing up my flight. Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care. It's a shame, since their planes and prices are very nice, the headache in dealing with the problems afterwards is just too much to fly with them again.",A330,Family Leisure,Business Class,Barcelona to Moscow,August 2017,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,no,being a loyal customer of this airline i was once again dissapointed with turkish airlines completely messing up my flight outbound flight tk from barcelona to istanbul left about minutes delayed and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to moscow which resulted in spending an entire night at the airlines lounge i would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport who are completely uninterested in helping you out pretending not to speak english and watching videos on their smartphones giggling and discussing it with each other while at the lounge you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than hours long so please know if you miss your flight due to the airlines fault you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem thats a fact the same situation happened to me in april while returning from miami to moscow via istanbul the airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child changing it only for me therefore i ended up paying for the completely new tickets overpaid around usd and once again the flight left late from miami and therefore we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport we were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline the airlines feedback form is awful and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved even visiting the airlines office in moscow does not help everything is managed through the website overall i am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care its a shame since their planes and prices are very nice the headache in dealing with the problems afterwards is just too much to fly with them again

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Michael Asher,23rd November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Took advantage of promotional fares on Turkish Airlinesâ€™ new route (when I booked) from Istanbul to Phuket. When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldnâ€™t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open. After check-in, Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,T. Eldem,9th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to New York with Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively painless considering it was at a very early hour of the morning. Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Benjamin Podszun,8th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore via Istanbul. FRA-IST then 2.5h layover and IST-SIN. The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn't arrive in Singapore. It's missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,R Masira,8th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use â€œold versionâ€ or â€œnew versionâ€ I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of â€“ why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesnâ€™t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, thereâ€™s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction.

When entering the plane we saw that it was 2+2 seats with good space and an IFE even if it was only a 2.50 hr flight. Was served a simple meal which was enough. Had a layover of 3.15 hr in Istanbul and went to the lounge. From all reviews the lounge was highlighted as something positive. I would say the lounge needs a refresh. Worn seats, crowded, closed food places, etc.. Not at all what I had in my mind. You could of course drink unlimited liquor. Istanbul to Antananarivo was the best Business travel ever.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,S Allett,6th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to London. My comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself. There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London,November 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,yes,verified review istanbul to london my comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself there is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people all they offer is booking a wheelchair how are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags a trolley and a guitar other airportsairlines have buggies at their disposal considering that some gates are minutes walk this is pretty poor when flying from an apron gate xx eg there are no business class buses for business class travelers and youre expected to stand in the bus for minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in when questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in they said economics and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show my overall rating of explained - on-board service food - on-board cleanliness of toilets floors often wet - lounge services food - male lounge staff often loud or shouting across the room - female lounge staff - ground services bustransport
Turkish Airlines,2.0,Masoud Gorjian,5th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Kim E Johansen,18th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,T Eldem,5th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively quick and efficient. Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Hendrikus Hofman,4th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce. We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged.

You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight.

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldnâ€™t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time.

At Istanbul, I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Justin Clark,9th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | London to Riyadh via Istanbul. I booked a seat by the window on the right-hand side. The flight left at 01:20 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Riyadh via Istanbul,September 2017,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,verified review london to riyadh via istanbul i booked a seat by the window on the right-hand side the flight left at so i expected to be able to sleep on going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row i believe the second to last row but wrote seat e i asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and i was supposed to be in the exact same seat - f i tried to engage them further but they just waved me off the flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie the person next to me who had taken my seat was a woman with a crying baby i said nothing to her as that would be rude and im not as rude as turkish airlines staff this is by no means the first time it has happened but only seems to be leaving or entering saudi arabia sometimes i appreciate a woman doesnt want to be seated next to a male stranger but this woman was still next to me and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why i chose to book the seat in advance instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone elses one good point was she had a huge blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which i will look for and use when i fly in future with a different airline of course
Turkish Airlines,8.0,Anders Pedersen,7th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Hong Kong - Istanbul - Copenhagen on B777-300 and A321, respectively. Flew 5+6 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FAâ€™s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (â€œDevonâ€). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze â€“ I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Ezequiel Fumo,3rd September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Buenos Aires to Barcelona via Istanbul. Seats are ok, but not the best. The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,M van der Sanden,22nd August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Brussels via Istanbul. Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more. No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid. When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Randal Frivold,11th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Michael Asher,10th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Dalaman to Istanbul Ataturk. Found the Business Class check-in tucked away in the corner of a seething departure hall. Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted!

Turkish Airlines,8.0,T Martins,9th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to London via Istanbul. First leg from Bangkok was an A330. Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by.

They are happy to take golf bags and skis free of charge, and diving equipment to three destinations free of charge, but the rest of the world they charge for. It really can't be that hard to handle some fins, a mask and a very small speargun for no charge can it, especially when these make up the only form of checked in baggage? And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either.

The only issue, nothing to do with the airline, is the last leg, Istanbul to London and it can be daunting especially after a 10 hour flight where you go through security checks twice and no laptops on hand baggage.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,M Newton,1st July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Gatwick to Bangkok via Istanbul. The arrival experience could be stepped up slightly. There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members. The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board. Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Kim Thomsen,29th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul. TK1980/TK0064. Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as â€œsalad and steakâ€ it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,W Robert Kmen,22nd June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I was particularly looking forward to TK 1, my first trans-Atlantic business class experience. In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,T. Eldem,15th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do.

We even found some time to toy around with the Golf simulator on the lower floor of the lounge.

TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,K Edwards,2nd May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This almost 11 hour flight happened in a brand-new aircraft. On-board entertainment as well as the seats were just perfect. As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,A Benado,26th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation.

Service and reliability is no better than most EU majors, and overall the comfort and service looks from another time. The seats and interiors are really old, and very narrow on the A320 models (a kid won't even fit). Service is not really outstanding like you read in reviews, just basic and a bit cheap. Cabin staff can be quite stiff and really not friendly, which does not give the best sense of welcome claimed in their marketing.

In both cases, the first flight was late, giving us barely 30 mins to catch the next flight whose gate was really far away. The connecting flight was also Turkish Airlines, but still there was no support at the airport even though their first flight was late. While coming back from Mumbai, at Istanbul, there was an additional security check and the queue was long and our flight was in 15 mins! Nobody gave us any support there either and by some luck, one of the fellow passengers in the same situation was told by people waiting with us that we can go to priority security check if the flight is leaving soon.

Turkish Airlines pretty much exceeded my expectations on the outward leg of my journey, and the service was even better on the return.

Also received the best amenities kit of any airline I've flown - not even Qatar gives out slippers and lip balm in theirs! No amenities kit on the Istanbul-Lisbon sector but it was more of the same: good entertainment, good food and drinks on board a clean B738. Cabin crew were very friendly on both sectors. Return sector was even better - the flight left the gate at Lisbon Airport on time. Good service once again with the regular drinks service, delicious meal of roasted meat and a very friendly bunch of flight attendants The entertainment system on board the A320 winglets was better than my outgoing flights, with a better touchscreen interface. Departure from Istanbul-Singapore also on-time, with a new A333 that had the newest entertainment system on board (it has live news from BBC and CNN). Good meal service once again with a relish pasta rigatoni, although I wish they didn't run out of meal choices on board. A slightly different brand of amenities kit was given out on this flight, but the contents were the same. On-time arrival in Singapore.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,S Andrews,6th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ivan Nikitin,27th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Moscow Vnukovo to Istanbul return in economy. Online service was a nightmare, the website is not loading properly, aircraft maps were screwed up, which made it impossible to order the seats you want. On the way to Istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology. The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight. Personal screens are great, but I found the quality of programming and translation to Russian is poor. Meal service was good, with a choice of alcohol, metal cutlery. The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies. The flight was uneventful, but the ground staff attitude to the passengers, and inability to solve problems created by Turkish Airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly Turkish Airlines ever again.",A321 / Boeing 737-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,VKO to IST,February 2017,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,verified review moscow vnukovo to istanbul return in economy online service was a nightmare the website is not loading properly aircraft maps were screwed up which made it impossible to order the seats you want on the way to istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology the aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight personal screens are great but i found the quality of programming and translation to russian is poor meal service was good with a choice of alcohol metal cutlery the beef was delicious and wine was much better than average though the presentation of the meal was messy cabin crew is generally friendly the worst part was our return trip to moscow we have arrived to istanbul ataturk airport to check in hours minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked and we might not be able to fly today check-in staff was awful rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when i noticed that our boarding passes didnt have a seat number she would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane after we started arguing the turkish airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal and the situation is our problem this is unbelievable after some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one and she printed our boarding passes no apologies the flight was uneventful but the ground staff attitude to the passengers and inability to solve problems created by turkish airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly turkish airlines ever again

Turkish Airlines,9.0,B Dowe,23rd January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bogota to Rome via Istanbul. We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places. Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at AtatÃ¼rk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at AtatÃ¼rk airport.

The catering was great (as always), so were the beverages. We arrived with a 1 hour delay. Apart from long queues at the passport control, which is not the fault of Turkish Airlines, I had to wait another hour for my luggage, which is the airline's handling agency fault.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,M Henderson,17th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Turkish Airlines is nice when everything goes right. However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens.

Turkish Airlines customer service extremely chaotic and disorganized, the worst flight experience I have ever had. I realize that the bad weather conditions (snow) was out of the airlines control on the night of 6th January in Istanbul, the service and the little information provided by TK was extremely poor and confusing. Soon after we landed in IST, we were informed that all flights were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. There was no clear information or guidance provided and the few (rude) TK staff members present at Ataturk airport seemed not interested / willing to assist passengers about what to do. All we got was wrong information and their ground staff kept sending us from one desk to another. That first night, after 4 hrs spent in the airport to get some information, I decided to go to an hotel paid by myself. The following morning (07 January) we were informed that all flights were cancelled again due to snow and I had to queue almost 7 hrs at the ticketing office to rebook my flight for the next day. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself again, as there was another extremely long queue at their hotel information desk. On 08 January, my flight to KRT cancelled again and again 7 hours of queue to rebook the flight. The third day I went to the airport in the morning, this time the flight was confirmed so I checked in and entered the departure area after passport control but the flight to KRT was cancelled once again at about 04.00 PM and again a chaotic queue at the immigration and after another queue at the ticket office to re-change my flight, with no help or guidance from TK staff.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,S Paneer,8th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul return. The food on the flight was some of the worst. I find the cabin staff can be quite surly. However, had a truly awful experience with their customer service during the return flight, Istanbul was hit by blizzards the afternoon of the evening return flight which caused chaos with cancellations of all flights from all Istanbul airports, unfortunate, not much one can do about the weather. What is deplorable is the experience I have had with their customer service. Given the situation as one can imagine the ticket sales/changes queue at the airport was astronomical with everyone trying to rearrange travel arrangements. Spoke with a THY staff member who said I could rearrange over the phone. Waiting for half an over on the phone reached a customer service representative who informed me that as the KL to Perth flight was with a partner airline and THY they could not complete the booking and I had to go in person to the THY ticket office. So I went to the other airport in Istanbul at 3am in a taxi in a blizzard. Upon arriving at the ticket sales office they said they emailed the partner airline but that we would have to wait for a confirmation response. No indication of time frames. We waited for an hour then a different staff member told us that there was no need for us to wait at the airport and that in fact there was no need for us to have come in person to the airport to do this and the call staff had misinformed us. After getting a few hours sleep I then spent half the day repeatedly calling Turkish Airlines chasing any updates. Eventually I was told that in fact we were on standby with the other airline which was strange as the other airlines website was showing tickets for sale. After tearing my hair out eventually I spoke directly with the original booking travel agent who changed the booking no problem wish I had done that sooner rather than wasting my time with THY. Unfortunately the same issue has happened again with the rebooked flight tonight being cancelled due to weather and I am now going through the entire process again. No one can or will give me a telephone number for the ticket sales office instead I am told that I have to get a taxi, drive an hour each way if I'm lucky in the snow and repeat the crazy process of telling the ticket sales office in person exactly what I've told the call centre for them to lodge the booking request with the other airline and then wait until who knows when for them to get back. I have repeatedly asked to speak to a more senior management staff at the call centre to resolve the issue to be told there is no one more senior.

But when I explained the situation to the supervisor on that day, he printed out a new business transfer ticket and replaced the missed one.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,G Crane,21st December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Johannesburg return via Istanbul. We had a nightmarish time making our reservation with Turkish Airlines. After reservation was made and tickets were issued, airlines unexpectedly change our flight time, flight date and flight number, and this happened several times. It caused us having to change hotel and other reservations several times, and having to stay at some cities longer (or shorter). Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago. As for the flights themselves, they were ok. Service was ok, a bit inconsistent on some flights. Some planes were older, others are newer. Cabins and bathrooms were clean, seats were comfortable.

While the ground staff at the Domestic IST CIP terminal are great in reserving front rows or exit seats for their premium Miles&Smiles members, unfortunately, the TGS ground staff in BJV are the opposite. When I asked politely if I could have a window seat towards the front of the cabin I was handed a boarding card with a seat in the last row with a grin. I then asked if I could do a last minute mileage upgrade. Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,S Hanakova,8th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | In September 2016 I had a horrible experience with Turkish Airlines. My flight (TK-476) was on 17/09 from Ekaterinburg (Russia) to Barcelona via Istanbul. The time of departure was supposed to be at 7.30 - arriving time to Istanbul at 10.15 and the departure to BCN at 14.40 - so having 4.25 hours would be more than enough to change the plane in Istanbul. Unfortunately the Turkish Airlines delayed the flight in Russia for more than 3 hours. I can understand that there might be some technical problems or something but in that case the company is supposed to ""think"" of its passengers and be more client-oriented which I haven't noticed. The representatives didn't give any explanations regarding the reasons of delay, time of the flight, food, etc. When we finally arrived to Istanbul we still had enough time to catch the plane to BCN (we had 1 hour before the flight) and they could delay the plane for 15-20 min to let us in (I was not the only passenger - we were like 20 people who found themselves in this situation). The only thing they said was ""sorry, you have to wait for the next plane"" (additional 5 hours of waiting). They ignored us and our questions. After that I asked for food and I was given some sort of a coupon which was possible to use only in some places in food court. The cheapest ones, as I realized later. So the only thing I managed to have using this coupon was a bottle of water. Therefore sitting in Istanbul airport waiting for the plane for 5 hours I had to spend my money on normal food in a normal place. For the information: before that in Russia I was waiting for 3 hours and nobody informed me about breakfast so again I had to spend my money on food there.

I called their HQ and even though I selected the English option, they continued to talk in Turkish. I then called the US office (might as well).

Turkish Airlines,4.0,M Kronz,16th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Munich return journey with Turkish Airlines. We had previously tried to rebook our flights via the TK homepage as we had originally planned to fly back to MUC on Friday 11th. Unfortunately, TKÂ´s homepage in Turkey is different (""old version"") from the one available in Germany (""new version""). If you try to rebook a flight or do your online check-in on the old version the programme will send you into nirvana. Thus we wasted half a day going to their city office at Taksim Square to rebook the flight with the help of an unfriendly and unpologetic office clerk who charged a hefty rebooking fee. For the online check-in we tried the Taksim Square office again which turned out to be closed but we were fortunate enough to find out there is another office nearby at Harbiye where the nice and helpful TK staff was able to assign our seats but not to print out our boarding passes - TK, an airline full of mystery.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ahmad Owaida,13th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Amman to Bogota via Istanbul. While the Amman to Istanbul trip was short and uneventful trouble started once you reach Ataturk airport. This is probably not the fault of the airline but the airport is in no way capable of handling so much traffic. The TK lounge is big and offers a lot, it is so crowded now that it has no premium feel about it - you feel stuck in a crowded noisy bus station. The wifi service is a joke and keeps disconnecting probably from the too large number of people trying to use the service. The planes used to Bogota were old A330s with the old style business class seats which meant no lie flat beds on a 15 hour flight. The crew (it happened to be the same crew on the flight out and back) spoke very little English and semed almost robotic in their behaviour.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,P Gralen,5th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Almaty return both flights on an old 737-800 rather than normal 737-900 I have experienced on this route before. Outbound flight is an overnight flight and the meal is served early in the flight allowing passengers to sleep for the rest of the journey. Experience was OK apart from the comfort of the seat. Legroom was great as I was in an exit seat, but the seat is very hard which is very uncomfortable for a 5 hour journey. The return flight some days later was on an identical (maybe the same) aircraft. A hot breakfast (that was actually very cold) was served at the beginning of the 6 hour return flight followed by some drinks a few hours later. For such a long journey I would expect a light refreshment to be served towards the latter part of the flight and a hotter meal. On both flights most of the crew were very indifferent and non-caring towards passengers with the exception of some who appeared to be from Kazakhstan who seemed to be smiling and helpful. On descent into Ataturk Airport water started to stream out of the ceiling (perhaps from melting ice) of the plane onto me and the passenger in front of me. We were both seated in exit row seats by the window. It was not possible to get out of my seat at this time as we were so close to landing so I had to use pillows and blankets to cover myself from the water. Due to a bird strike incident with the plane in front of us we had to ascend sharply to make another landing approach. We flew for a further ten minutes before landing safely. Pilot communication during this incident was very acceptable which was pleasing. I advised the flight attendant on exiting about the water leak and my clothing she told me that this sometimes happens - very poor attitude towards customer. In future I'll probably consider another carrier for this route. I was surprised TK use such an older plane on such a long journey and the attitude of their cabin crew.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,G Ulrich,1st November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Zurich to Bogota via Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,B Johnson,7th October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | This is the first time we have flown with Turkish Airlines and it was superb. Check in was quick and easy as was the priority fast track and boarding. On board the first flight the crew were friendly, helpful and attentive. The seats wide and comfortable and the food and wines excellent. The lounge in Istanbul was large but with plenty of seating and a wide choice of freshly cooked food and snacks. Not that we ate having had a delicious lunch. We boarded the plane to Mauritius and were immediately impressed by the welcome, the cleanliness and the comfort of the cabin. Straight after take off the Chef (yes they have an on board chef) came round with the dinner menu. Pre dinner drinks were served with small bowls of nuts and olives to be followed by a variety of hot and cold canapÃ©s served from the trolley. Our tray tables were beautifully set and dinner was served with all the little extra chefs touches just like in a first class restaurant. After an truly wonderful meal the cabin crew asked could they make up our beds. A bed pack was produced with mattress pillows and duvet. Our seats then became fully flat beds and I had a restful night. Having already chosen our breakfast we were wakened to yet another lovely meal. Arrival was on time and our baggage arrived quickly We had the same experience on our return flights nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,John A Peters,4th October 2016,"Service on board was excellent, perhaps in part due to the fact that the business cabin was at most half occupied. The flight from Chicago to Istanbul is a evening/night flight, so we were first served a dinner and then the flight attendants made up the lie-flat bed. One really has to commend Turkish for the excellent, restaurant quality food they serve on board. Also a good selection of beverages. Flight attendants provided excellent service. One negative which I experienced last year with Turkish as well.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,P Trealader,3rd October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dar es Salaam to London via Istanbul. I was on an overnight flight from Dar es Salaam departing at 03.25 to arrive at Attaturk Airport at 10.25 later that morning. The plane was an old model and the seats did not recline completely. Sleep was not easy. One of the stewardess's in the business section could barely speak English, was unable to make herself understood and spent a lot of time opening & shutting overhead compartments in the business section, making it difficult for me to sleep (I was in seat 2B). My problem arose at Attaturk Airport when, only having a 2 hour layover, I chose to go to the business class lounge to relax until the connecting flight to London. However, I fell asleep and woke 20 minutes before take off. What I hadn't realised was that the gate was a 25 minute walk from the lounge and though I ran I made it to the gate only to be told the gate had closed, that I would need to go to the information desk to get another ticket for an alternative flight to London. When asked for instructions to the information desk, I was given incorrect information as to how to get there. Every member of the ground staff I asked told me a different direction, and were most unhelpful. Eventually I was told I needed to go to the transfer department - again given incorrect directions. Finally when I spoke to a member of staff there, he told me I had to go to the ticket office as he could not issue a ticket for me. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the ticket office. Back to information, who told me I had to go through passport control. When I got there I was told I needed a visa. Why? After all I'm airside, I'm not leaving the airport - no one had the courtesy to tell me that the only place I could buy a new ticket was outside the transit area. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the visa desk. I purchased a visa that cost me Â£20, went through passport control and eventually managed to find the ticket office. Again, I was met by very surly ticket office sales staff who were most unhelpful and who tore up my boarding pass & suggested I would have to pay a further Â£1050 for a business class ticket or Â£435 for a single economy ticket. She suggested if I wanted to try to buy one cheaper, I could do so online. When asked what the Wi-Fi code was, I was told there wasn't any. Having no alternative but to buy the economy ticket, I was then told to go to the incorrect check in desk! Standing in line for ages, when I got to the desk, I was told I had to go to 'C' section. Finally I came across the one and only helpful staff member, who understood my predicament, was sympathetic and helped me through the process of locating my luggage (which had obviously been off loaded from the original aircraft I was supposed to be on) and assured me it would be on the flight I was now booked on. I was aware that I had a restricted ticket and would therefore forfeit the ticket for a no show, or cancellation etc, however, what I did not expect was the rudeness and unhelpfulness from Turkish Airlines ground staff. I certainly would never book with Turkish Airlines again.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,T Eldem,24th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Montreal via Istanbul. Check in at JNB was uneventful. Turkish Airlines uses the SAA lounge which is pretty ordinary but food choices are extensive. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft but was conducted in an orderly manner. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept and the FA's were friendly and spoke very good English. Food and wine quality were good but I would have liked to have a few South African wines. Dinner and drink service was very slow and it took us over three hours to get to desert once we were airborne. The aircraft on the JNB-IST leg did not have wifi and although the IFE had a large selection of movies, it was on the skinny side when it came to new releases. Flight landed on time and with almost every flight we were bussed to the terminal. Spent a few hours in the Istanbul lounge which is well and truly an amazing experience with a very large array of food and beverage offerings. Boarding on the second leg was absolutely chaotic and TK should be ashamed of putting their premium passengers through that ordeal. Once again we were bussed to the aircraft. The second A330 was brand new and the crew and their service were outstanding. I felt pampered throughout the 10 hour flight and was able to catch 3 hours of very comfortable rest in the lie flat seats. The WiFi on the second leg did not work despite the pursers countless efforts to get it up and running. The food on the second leg was superior to the first which likely was related to catering being done out of TK's hub in Istanbul. The flight landed on time but the luggage delivery was slow with priority bags coming out towards the end.

Flight times changed and I made to contact to customer services (cannot be done on their website) to book the new time schedule. I had great trouble to understand their English.

But the domestic flight delayed too and we arrived there at 12:35 midnight to find that one of the luggage was left in Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,W Renny,12th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Kilimanjaro to London Heathrow via Istanbul. My route on the way to Tanzania wasn't too bad, although my friends bag did get lost. On the way home it was a terrible 24 hours. We got to Kilimanjaro airport early and then when it came to check in three people from my group including myself weren't on the list to fly! We had to wait till after check in had closed for someone to drive to the airport with a different list, during this time we were told nothing we had no idea if we would definitely be on that flight. We finally got through and then very quickly had to go through security again and wait to board. We had a two hour wait even though our plane had arrived - we got given no information. I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours due to the fact you can't take liquids into the airport and then the only place I could buy a drink I was only there for a minute until I had to move again into somewhere we couldn't take liquids. They had moved some people up to business class and then after about an hour took in everyones tickets and got them reprinted, back to economy. Finally once we were on and then arrived at Istanbul, due to the fact we were 2 hours late one of my friends travelling with us had missed her next flight. Throughout the whole journey she was asking for help, she was literally on the back seat of the plane and wouldn't allow her to be one of the first to get off so she was the last person off. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to the airport. Once there we tried to find someone to help her, she asked someone who sent her to somewhere you go if you didn't have a boarding pass - this wasn't the issue (causing her to be even later). We asked 5 people at the airport for help and the staff were all rude saying 'I'm busy' and walking off. Eventually we found someone who told her where to go but it was too late she had missed her flight. I then got on my next plane to Heathrow, once landed at 4.30 I went to collect my luggage, I waited an hour and a half for them to then say 'That's all the bags.' Which meant 6 out of 7 people I was with didn't have their rucksacks. We all went over to lost luggage and there we got told all our bags weren't on the flight and that they were on the next flight coming from Istanbul. If we had been told this earlier it wouldn't have been as big an issue yet we waited an hour and half and parking at an airport isn't cheap! There was no communication at all. We got told we could wait till the next flight came in which was gone 9 in the evening or get our bags delivered to us in a few days.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,T Eldem,10th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was handled by a ground agent and not a Turkish Airlines staff. It was a little slow as I wanted my bag checked only to Istanbul and not my final destination. Turkish uses an affiliated lounge in Montreal which was packed with standing room only so I left and walked over to the Air Canada lounge which was very quiet. Boarding was slow with business and coach passengers processed at the same time but through different queues. On top of it, passengers were kept waiting in the jetway as the crew was not ready. Onboard the aircraft looked newish. The FA's were courteous and spoke decent English. The lie-flat seat was comfortable but narrow and the crew turned into a bed by using a mattress and duvet. Service was prompt and food and beverages including champagne were of high quality. IFE had a rich selection of movies and the screen was a decent size. Wi-Fi connectivity was great.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Francine Romaro,3rd September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | On 16th July, some hours after the coup attempt in Turkey, I went to the Munich airport expecting that my flight to SFO with a stop in Istanbul would be cancelled, but for my surprise, at the check-in I was informed by the Turkish Airline staff that the situation in Turkey was normal and that my flight from Istanbul to San Francisco was confirmed. So I got the flight to Istanbul but the situation I found at the airport was terrible. A lot of flights were cancelled. I found out that my flight to SFO was delayed by 5 hours, so I went to the gate and waited there. Then, after 5 hours waiting, they announced that all flights on that day were cancelled and asked passengers to go out of the terminal and ask for a hotel in the Turkish Airlines desk. I went out of the airport but my luggage was not in the baggage carrousel. I went to the hotel desk and they asked everybody there to enter in a bus and we were taken to a hotel. There a Turkish Airlines staff told me that my luggage will be delivered to the hotel and that my flight to SFO was confirmed to the next day. At the next day, we discovered that all flights from Turkey to USA were cancelled and we should wait another day. At the second, the flight was again cancelled, so I was given the option to return to Munich and request a refund of the flight to SFO. So I returned to Munich, but my luggage was lost (they didn't deliver it at the hotel as promised). I filed a report for lost baggage at my arrival at the Munich airport on 18th July and as instructed, I opened a complaint on the Turkish Airlines site on 25th July.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,H Patchell,16th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Niamey to London Heathrow via Istanbul. What a hectic night. We sat on the plane on the tarmac for two and a bit hours because they lost an oxygen tank and couldn't find a new one. They then cancelled our flight and stuck us back in the terminal. Then the heavens opened. Obviously the best option was to stick 200 grumpy passengers outside in the thunder, lightning and rain. Next, they took us 4 at a time in taxis to an hotel. My wife and I were put into what appeared to be the remnant of a much hated Toyota Corrolla. We hung out there for a bit with a guy who spoke no English whatsoever. Once he left us alone in his car and we realised we were going nowhere we accosted a man with a Turkish airlines jacket in a dark car park (still raining). He put us on a bus which proceeded to tour Niamey at 3:00am with the AC on full blast which helped our wet cloths become much more effective in helping us contract some illness. Finally after messing about for a total 6 hours, at 4:00am we got a hotel which makes faulty towers look like New York's Waldorf hotel. There we were left in the hands of the Receptionist. What he lacked linguist ability and clarity of speech he made for in volume and repetition. Needless to say information about our fate was lacking. At around around 7:30am a rumour spread that our suffering may end by 8:00pm that evening. Finally at 8:00pm we were herded into a bus and taken to the airport. There, the Turkish Airlines staff directed us to line up and walk around Niamey airport. At the departure gate our boarding passes and baggage tags were handed out.

As we arrive at the airport we learn all flights to USA have been cancelled again. We go to the ticket sales where a woman finds us a new flight from Istanbul to Frankfurt and a Lufhtansa flight from Frankfurt to LAX, the day after again. One more night in Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,D Rallieme,14th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | We flew from Los Angeles to Geneva via Istanbul. Flight from LAX to IST was full and while the catering, inflight entertainment and cabin staff service were good, the impression that remained from this flight was the lack of leg room for such a long haul flight. I'm 1m 80 and my wife 1m 76, which has nothing exceptional in the European population and despite having removed all brochures from the seat pockets in front of us, our knees in a normal seating position were touching the seats in front of us (that were not even inclined). We battled during this 12h30 flight to find the most confortable position without success. A real pity that TK accomodate maximum seats in Economy despite very good 9 seats abreast configuration on this 777-300 (vs 10 for many other airlines). Like many European travelers, we have been attracted to Turkish Airlines by their competitive prices (around 50% cheaper than AF, BA, LH, LX when we booked to the ticket early April), their enviable reputation of Best European Airline by Skytrax for several years in a row and their staff reliability (no strikes recorded during the last few years compare to AF/LH for instance). Transit via IST was OK while extremely crowded highlighting again the dramatic need for TK to operate from the new airport under construction.

We landed normally on time, July 15th, 11pm in Istanbul for a short transfer for the next flight - but that was not to be. Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,V Ozan,8th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I often fly Turkish Airlines economy class, but this time I flew business class Istanbul-Riga-Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is my favorite airline, but business class exceeded all my expectations. In Istanbul Ataturk airport I could check-in and use the business class passage for migration/security control - which is very valuable in such a busy and crowded airport.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Rebecca Dempsey,19th July 2016,"My partner and I were on flight TK53 from Tokyo to Istanbul and were due to get a connecting flight home to Dublin (TK1975). Approximately 2 hours before we landed, we saw live TV coverage of the Coup from Istanbul and waited for updates from cabin crew. An hour later, the pilot announced that we would not be landing in Istanbul due to ""operational reasons"". This was the one and only announcement given until 12 hours later. We landed in Antalya and were brought into a working terminal. We sat and waited patiently. At 6am, we were bussed to another terminal - an unused, abandoned terminal with no facilities or options to get food and very little air con on what was an extremely warm morning. There were no reps from Turkish Airlines, there was no WIFI, there was no communication of any sort. At midday, a cafe was opened and food served at high prices. The free food of water and bread became tiresome as that was our only option since landing at 4am. At 8pm we were informed our flight would be returning to Istanbul and there we would be met by reps who would transfer our boarding passes. We were assured all would run smoothly and we would have the option of getting a hotel for the night. Upon arrival at Istanbul, we joined the queue for the transfer desk. It took 6.5 hours to reach the top of the queue - no reps, nobody to answer questions, no customer service whatsoever.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,Cameron Wenzel,18th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew New York JFK to Brussels via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines was great, definitely recommend. The food was very good for economy class - I ordered vegetarian meals, which are almost always bland and generally awful, but I had no complaints. They seemed rather sophisticated and quite tasty for airline food, and you actually eat with real, metal utensils. The seats were comfortable enough (probably the most average portion of the flight), and my transatlantic flight had TVs (as expected for a 10-11 hr flight) with good selection, and my shorter flight (4 hrs) had overhead TVs that were available for everyone to watch. Best part of Turkish, though, is that they really do take care of you. On my transatlantic voyage, they provided a package with slippers/blanket/sleep mask/headphones/toothbrush and more. The bathrooms had real flowers in them, and they came around many times with food and drink - first with Turkish Delight, then with a different cake, then with dinner, then coffee/tea, then breakfast, then coffee/tea a second time).

Turkish Airlines,7.0,MJ Jitesh,14th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew with Turkish Airlines from London Heathrow to Seoul via Istanbul on the 28th of June. During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,O Anderson,3rd July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Turkish Airlines from Milano Malpensa (IT) to San Francisco via Istanbul, with my wife and two kids. On the first leg (Milano to Istanbul), we received a full meal and my kids dedicated gifts (toys and book). On the main leg from Istanbul to San Francisco, we received complimentary trousses (yes, in the economy class) two full meals + free availability of sandwiches and beverages, my kids received other dedicated gifts and trousses. Meals were generally good, even the pasta was good. The Flight Entertainment System maybe needs some adjustments: the games keep freezing, so I had to ask to the staff (really friendly and responsive) to restart at least three time the display of one on my sons. We did the online check-in, so we had a dedicated counter fro baggage drop-off at check-in, avoiding the queues of the economy class. Unfortunately, in seat map shown during online check-in the presence of the baby bassinettes was not indicated, so I discovered it only during the flight, not so comfortable. Moreover, the website is not so user friendly, it is impossible to select a special meal for example. Conclusion: Airline, staff and services really OK.

Food and entertainment were on par with other carriers. But when things go wrong, TK falls apart. A technical fault delayed my flight back from Berlin. Initially, the delay was announced to be 90 minutes, meaning many passengers would miss connections in IST, including myself. The fate of transit passengers was left to the transfer desk in IST, as TXL ground staff refused to do anything. This was extremely nerve-racking because my connecting flight to SIN operated only daily, so I would have had to stay overnight in IST if I missed it. When I explained the situation and asked to be re-booked from TXL, ground staff rejected my request, and said they could do nothing nor provide any information on my connecting flight. Several transit passengers were frustrated over the lack of answers resulting in arguments with ground staff. There were further delays during boarding, and no explanations or revised departure time was provided. Eventually, the flight left 2.5 hours late. In IST, transfer desk said SIN flight was over 4 hours late. Why couldnâ€™t the ground staff in TXL tell me this?

Arrival / departure times are inconvenient which may be a contributing factor. TK use the new Number 1 lounge at LGW. The â€˜onboard chefâ€™ on TK flights is a lot of fuss about nothing. The â€˜chefâ€™ on the first short sector to IST is simply a flight attendant in a chefâ€™s hat who serves the drinks and most of the food. There was no chef on the long-haul sector. The food offering was excellent on both flights. There is a Turkish flair to the menu (Mezze, Turkish coffee, Turkish wines), however there is enough to choose from to please the less adventurous palate. The seat is clearly the reason that the lower fares are currently offered on the route. The seats are not flatbed. They are similar to most airlineâ€™s Premium Economy seat offer. Good leg-room, a foot rest and good recline. Other than that a normal medium haul business class seat. If I was paying the fare BA or KQ charge on the route I would have something to grumble about, but I am not â€“ so did not. Everyone talks about the lounge at IST. It certainly is large, and impressive with self-service bars throughout, deli-style counters with sweets, cakes and savoury options. The pizza chefs, BBQ chefs, pasta chefs cook for the streams of passengers queuing for them. There is a virtual golf range, scalextric track to â€˜playâ€™ with in addition to cinemas, pool tables and a huge library. There are massage therapists with whom you can book an in-seat massage too - but order this early as waiting times can be long. The thing is, the lounge is so big you tend to sit in one spot where you find a seat (there are no â€˜quiet areasâ€™, just lots of seats and tables dotted around). Itâ€™s big and brash (like the network and advertising for it), and I will go back â€“ but itâ€™s not â€˜specialâ€™. The staff were also not especially welcoming. Questions about availability of yoghurt for example was met with a disinterested, â€œI donâ€™t know â€“ look over thereâ€. There was no feeling of being a special guest. It felt more like we were being done a favour by being allowed into the lounge â€“ now we must fend for ourselves. Even if you are not travelling in business class, IST is a fab transit point. Excellent shops, restaurants and bars. Both my wife and I said it will be our preferred transit stop, whichever class we travel in future. Signage could be improved and the information points were staffed were not interested in offering any form of â€˜customer serviceâ€™. The one time we asked for directions we were answered with grunts and a tired â€˜nodâ€™ in the direction we should go. I would hesitate letting anyone transit alone who was unsure about how to get around an airport (elderly parent etc.), simply because of the lack of genuine help available by the staff on duty. The service of the flight to Kenya was equally good with nice choices from the menu. The presentation could do with some work â€“ meals brought out from the galley wrapped in foil (from an airline boasting top cuisine and a chef?) which is unceremoniously unwrapped in front of you. Turkish coffee was made from instant powder in full view of the cabin before being served (nicely) with Turkish delight. This was a little disappointing. Overall, a good product at an excellent price. The food service is good and transit process reasonably easy for frequent travellers. We will definitely book this airline again on this route.",Boeing 737-900ER,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LGW to MBA via IST,April 2016,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,yes,verified review london gatwick to mombasa with turkish airlines tk currently have rock-bottom fares around return to mba from lgw arrival departure times are inconvenient which may be a contributing factor tk use the new number lounge at lgw the onboard chef on tk flights is a lot of fuss about nothing the chef on the first short sector to ist is simply a flight attendant in a chefs hat who serves the drinks and most of the food there was no chef on the long-haul sector the food offering was excellent on both flights there is a turkish flair to the menu mezze turkish coffee turkish wines however there is enough to choose from to please the less adventurous palate the seat is clearly the reason that the lower fares are currently offered on the route the seats are not flatbed they are similar to most airlines premium economy seat offer good leg-room a foot rest and good recline other than that a normal medium haul business class seat if i was paying the fare ba or kq charge on the route i would have something to grumble about but i am not so did not everyone talks about the lounge at ist it certainly is large and impressive with self-service bars throughout deli-style counters with sweets cakes and savoury options the pizza chefs bbq chefs pasta chefs cook for the streams of passengers queuing for them there is a virtual golf range scalextric track to play with in addition to cinemas pool tables and a huge library there are massage therapists with whom you can book an in-seat massage too - but order this early as waiting times can be long the thing is the lounge is so big you tend to sit in one spot where you find a seat there are no quiet areas just lots of seats and tables dotted around its big and brash like the network and advertising for it and i will go back but its not special the staff were also not especially welcoming questions about availability of yoghurt for example was met with a disinterested i dont know look over there there was no feeling of being a special guest it felt more like we were being done a favour by being allowed into the lounge now we must fend for ourselves even if you are not travelling in business class ist is a fab transit point excellent shops restaurants and bars both my wife and i said it will be our preferred transit stop whichever class we travel in future signage could be improved and the information points were staffed were not interested in offering any form of customer service the one time we asked for directions we were answered with grunts and a tired nod in the direction we should go i would hesitate letting anyone transit alone who was unsure about how to get around an airport elderly parent etc simply because of the lack of genuine help available by the staff on duty the service of the flight to kenya was equally good with nice choices from the menu the presentation could do with some work meals brought out from the galley wrapped in foil from an airline boasting top cuisine and a chef which is unceremoniously unwrapped in front of you turkish coffee was made from instant powder in full view of the cabin before being served nicely with turkish delight this was a little disappointing overall a good product at an excellent price the food service is good and transit process reasonably easy for frequent travellers we will definitely book this airline again on this route

Turkish Airlines,1.0,R Kammas,8th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Antalya to Frankfurt via Istanbul. Out of 4 airplanes flown, 3 were rather dirty and had limited or no entertainment systems. No WiFi was available onboard. After arrival in Istanbul, it took 10 minutes for the stairs to arrive and another 10 minutes for the shuttle buses to come. Istanbul domestic is similar to La Guardia. Miles&Smiles I contacted TK more than 10 times and spend USD 60 on phone costs without getting any professional reply - at both Istanbul Miles&Smiles desks the staff was busy doing their personal things and any customer was an unwelcomed intrusion. The girl at the outside Miles&Smiles desk made it clear that she will not answer any questions and is only hired to print cards. The guy at the int'l inside Miles&Smiles desk refused to answer my question and I had to pay USD 30 entry fee to a nearby lounge to get my answer. Don't call them. Just write a message and maybe you will receive a reply within 2-8 biz days. If you have anything urgent, too bad. If you have a question at check-in, go directly to the supervisor. There, you might have a chance to get an answer - I asked the supervisor at the Istanbul lounge about the lousy Miles&Smiles service. She refused to answer, refused to investigate, and refused to forward anything. She told me to write an email to customer care - Turkish Airlines staff guided me to the wrong security check-in, because of that, I was stuck with customs / police for over an hour. There is no Turkish Airlines customer care service at Istanbul domestic airport or outside of security at the international terminal. I contacted customer care and didn't receive any answer to any of above raised points. Turkish Airlines have a few points that they advertise and that are great (like the Istanbul lounge), with most other things, I felt like Turkish Airlines is only a large cheap budget airline.

Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,T Merter,21st April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to London Heathrow. Fast and welcoming check-in experience at IST this time. Great lounge and direct fast track access as usual. On time departure and scheduled arrival to LHR. Both the ground and onboard experience are superior to anything on offer by other European carriers. Refined catering with several meal choices, even though the business cabin was nearly full, all meal choices were available.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Lawrence Osborne,14th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated. As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Simon Summers,13th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet.

Boarding in Mumbai was fine on time. Food (Indian vegeterian) was good, cabin crew were helpful and asked us if we need baby food. Transit in Istanbul is the only worst part (so far) of this airline. Plane doesn't park at aerobridge and you need to take shuttle bus from plane to airport. Walk from airport entry gate to lounge is long. No pram for family travelers. You need to go through a security check before reaching transit area or lounge.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Aleksander Saeth,30th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Oslo to Dhaka via Istanbul return. I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only). Turkish would rather exploit it's customers. The irony is that this very trip was the one that earned me the last points for a membership upgrade.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Peter Down,25th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I currently work in Adjara, Georgia and the nearest airport is at Batumi. As I am a UK citizen, I frequently fly between Manchester, UK and Batumi, Georgia via Istanbul Ataturk. I have made bookings for three trips between Batumi and Istanbul over the last three months and I have to say the performance of the airline on this route is shockingly poor. On 29 December 2015, my flight from Istanbul to Batumi was cancelled. Weather conditions at Batumi were blamed. I was offered an alternative flight to Trabzon, Turkey instead being told there would be a bus transfer to Batumi. On arrival at Trabzon, there was no information about a bus transfer and no-one seemed to have clue about what to do. Eventually, I managed to find someone who put me on a bus (it was obvious this had not been arranged to cater for the disruption) which then left meet at the Georgian border at Sarpi. I was then forced to make my own travel arrangements from there. On 24 February 2016 my flight from Batumi to Istanbul was cancelled. Once again weather conditions were blamed. Today (24 March) my flight from Batumi to Istanbul has again been cancelled with weather conditions at Istanbul Ataturk airport being blamed. However, on checking the Turkish Airlines website, it was noted that other international flights are recorded as having landed at this airport at around the same time my own was due to land. My work colleagues have also experienced similar disruptions and cancellations to their flights over the last three months (some of their experiences were even worse!). The flight between Istanbul and Batumi is supposed to be a scheduled daily flight. However, the level of disruption leads many of us working here in Georgia to believe the airline does not value its customers and can just cancel flights when it wishes if it believes it does not have enough passengers - with weather conditions being blamed as a way to avoid having to pay compensation.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Mona Farrugia,23rd March 2016,âœ… Verified Review | Malta to Kilimanjaro via Dar es Salaam. We are frequent flyers with Turkish Airlines and our experience in this case was bad enough that we will probably never fly with them again. 7 hour flights at 2am and 4am in aircraft so small and old that the seat inclined (when it worked) just 30 degrees. Crew mostly indifferent. Food also indifferent - normally the food and service plus sky chefs on Turkish warrant a 5 star review on their own. We asked at Istanbul lounge if we could speak to a member of customer service about our experience and they said 'No. Post via the website'. So we did. Nobody even acknowledged. We love the Istanbul lounge and the food there and (normally) the food on board. But in general indifferent has got into the habit of seeing customers as pesky unwanted extras that get in the way of their job. So maybe they're just telling us to go to another airline.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,R Thomas,22nd March 2016,"Flight from Dubai was delayed by an hour. Reached Istanbul expecting to have missed my flight as I arrived 30 mins before the flight. As soon as I arrived and finished Transfer Security Check, on checking the screen for the flights, Catania was missing from the Screen. Customer care they told me I have to change the Ticket at the transfer desk. On reaching the Transfer Desk I found there were quite a few travellers to Catania facing this issue. After the long queue, the guy at the counter had no idea what was going on and did not even care when I asked him what happened. One person at the counter said the flight had been cancelled so they are making a new flight early morning next day. Another Staff said the flight took off. Staff treated us as if we were cattle and without any hesitation decided which flight we ought to take. Finally after deciding I would go at the 6:45 am flight the next day, they arranged for the hotel stay and ask me to contact the hotel desk outside passport control. On asking about Visa, they say that I need to pay an extra 43USD. I found it pathetic that inspite of robbing us the time and our money for a service we paid to reach a destination at a certain time, they had the audacity to ask the passengers to pay extra.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Tania Ferrara,22nd March 2016,"Our family of 4, flew with Turkish airlines from London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul return. London to Istanbul the aircraft was excellent, equipped with the latest entertainment - essential for keeping the kids occupied! The staff on board were so friendly and welcoming. From Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur, I couldn't help feeling as if we had been 'downgraded' as the front row in which we were sitting, only 1 out of 4 screens worked! One was stuck and 3 didn't work, so as there was ample space behind, my husband and son moved backwards, which was ok but meant we were sitting separately for most of the flight. The staff were less friendly than the first. These two factors made me feel a little disheartened. On our return journey, from Kuala Lumpur to London via Istanbul, we had an excellent journey. The entertainment was excellent, food was delicious, toilets were maintained and kept clean to a high standard and the staff were superb. However on the last leg of the journey, from Istanbul to London, we were very disappointed with the aircraft itself. It felt as if we were on a low cost carrier, as there was literally no entertainment onboard as there seemed to be a technical glitch on all the screens. That was a huge disappointment, as we expected to have a good quality plane, having paid a premium price for the journey. But the staff were exceptional and did their best to cater for us, ensuring the children were comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed flying on Turkish Airlines. They seem to take pride in the cleanliness of their aircraft, which says a lot about an airline. The food was to a high standard and the kids were gifted various toys as souvenirs of their journey.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,John Moloney,6th March 2016,"Check in at Gatwick was quick and was advised that flight to Istanbul was on time. By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay. Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded.

(so more than 3 hours before the departure time). The lady who attended me at the check-in counter first gave me the boarding tickets putting me and my family in sequential seats in the same row (51). But before she gave me the boarding tickets, she decided to talk to another attendant and after that she decided to reprint the tickets putting us in totally different seats. Note: one of the passengers was my daughter and she is just 1.5 years old! I tried several times to explain to the check-in lady that I was flying with my daughter and at least the father or the mother must travel together with her â€“ I bought a seat for her just to provide better accommodation and to not bother the other passengers. But she became angry and arrogant, just told me that I would have to solve this â€œproblemâ€ by myself with the gate staff or even with the flight attendants, or even ask people in the airplane to change the seats with me. So in summary the problem was created by Turkish Airlines and I would have to solve it by myself. At that time, I started to be angry with the arrogance and incompetence of the check-in staff, starting with the point that is simply unacceptable to have people working for Turkish Airlines in the International check-in desk who are not fluent in English â€“ without mentioning that they simply ignored the fact that a 1.5 years-old baby would fly alone with the insane arrangement this lady provided me at the check-in desk. Well, still following the instructions gave to me by the check-in lady, two other ladies who were working at the gate simply ignored my requirements. Only after I had to yell to one of that women, she told me (with a very angry face that she could not help me and I would have to solve this problem by myself inside the plane. When the gate was released for embarking, another employee required and took over my tickets and asked me and my family to wait outside the finger. We waited about 20 minutes and when almost all passengers entered into the plane, another employee gave me the tickets back and said that I would have to solve the problem by myself. At that time, I was fed up with the arrogance of employees who forced me to wait 20 minutes for nothing, and once I entered into the plane I had to start to yell in order to be attended by the chief of flight attendants, who had the courage to propose my wife to hold my daughter in the same seat, giving away to another passenger the extra seat that we bought.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,S May,2nd February 2016,"Worst customer service I have experienced. I arrived at the Turkish Airlines check in counter in Istanbul 2.5 hours prior to my scheduled departure and was told the flight was overbooked so I would be placed on standby, but should get on the flight. I didn't and from there the nightmare began. I was sent to 4-5 different counters and told different instructions at each one. No one at Turkish Airlines seemed interested in getting me on another flight. I understand overbooking flights is a common practice by most airlines, but there appeared to be no standard process in place to deal with passengers who have been bumped. The staff were extremely rude, unhelpful and offered no apology for my 7 hour delay. There was promise of compensation, but I haven't seen any compensation yet.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Rony Liebheit,1st February 2016,"While in Nepal we were informed of a 2 hr delay of our Turkish Airlines return flight upon arrival in IST. There was no info about the connecting flight to Stuttgart for which there would be only 1/2 h to get it. Back in KTM we learned that we'd have to stay the night in IST. We managed to get a flight a day earlier, thus at least making up for the time loss. The flight was very pleasant. But info and service on arrival that evening in IST was appalling. We had to find our own way through the airport, no signs and not knowing where to report for the hotel supplied by the airline. After standing in line for the passport controll we were told we need a visa, so we had to go back to another counter and pay 50 USD for a visa. When, finally finding the counter for the hotel, there was another long lineup and and afterwards we sat waiting for a shuttle. The hotel was 10 min away, very nice and we got a late supper around 22:30. The food was disappointing. Next morning, without breakfast, we had to shuttle back to the airport at 5 in the morning for a 9:30 flight. We were through security and passport controlls by 5:30, the gate wasn't announced until 8:20 and only then we were able to go and sit. All these are things that happen when travelling. But what annoys me to no end is that the airline refuses to refund our visa fee. What makes it worse is the reason given: we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight, flying a day earlier. I suppose we did acknowledge the delay -2 hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses. The downtown airline office in STG does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way. The same applies to the airport office. My request then forwarded to IST was first returned because it was in German. For every message to IST one has to jump all the hoops on their website and over and over again fill out the forms. The very poor info-policy and service of Turkish Airlines, the only way to deal with the airline through IST and not in one's own country and the refusal to refund our visa fee totally spoils an otherwise pleasant experience with the airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,KTM to STR via IST,January 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no,while in nepal we were informed of a hr delay of our turkish airlines return flight upon arrival in ist there was no info about the connecting flight to stuttgart for which there would be only h to get it back in ktm we learned that wed have to stay the night in ist we managed to get a flight a day earlier thus at least making up for the time loss the flight was very pleasant but info and service on arrival that evening in ist was appalling we had to find our own way through the airport no signs and not knowing where to report for the hotel supplied by the airline after standing in line for the passport controll we were told we need a visa so we had to go back to another counter and pay usd for a visa when finally finding the counter for the hotel there was another long lineup and and afterwards we sat waiting for a shuttle the hotel was min away very nice and we got a late supper around the food was disappointing next morning without breakfast we had to shuttle back to the airport at in the morning for a flight we were through security and passport controlls by the gate wasnt announced until and only then we were able to go and sit all these are things that happen when travelling but what annoys me to no end is that the airline refuses to refund our visa fee what makes it worse is the reason given we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight flying a day earlier i suppose we did acknowledge the delay - hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses the downtown airline office in stg does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way the same applies to the airport office my request then forwarded to ist was first returned because it was in german for every message to ist one has to jump all the hoops on their website and over and over again fill out the forms the very poor info-policy and service of turkish airlines the only way to deal with the airline through ist and not in ones own country and the refusal to refund our visa fee totally spoils an otherwise pleasant experience with the airline

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Murat Ayber,31st January 2016,"Turkish Airlines flight from Ankara to Istanbul with 6 hours delay on 21 January 2016. Boarding time was 10.25 and departure (scheduled) 10.55. Boarding completed and the gate was closed around 10.45. Normally this route is only 50 minutes. There was severe snow in Ankara. The aircraft has waited nearly two hours before take-off. Two hours later gave the news the flight had been cancelled. The passengers were requested to wait in the aircraft till it boards the gate. However 40 minutes after the announcement of cancellation, we heard another announcement that the aircraft perform its flight, however certain passengers declared that they do not want to fly, so the aircraft will wait till they leave and then perform the flight - the cancellation decision has been cancelled. Certain passengers left the aircraft voluntarily. Those who opted to fly waited till their luggage be removed. The following surprise was, the aircraft accepted new passengers once certain passengers left and their luggages removed. The newcomers luggage loaded in Cargo. Then another announcement ""Those passengers Who do not want to fly may get off"". A second wave of passengers left the aircraft and their luggages removed. The total delay has been 6 hours. Two consecutive flights on the same ESB-IST route after our TK2127 have been performed with 60-90 minutes delay. Snow is not sufficient to explain the reason of such delay. The cabin crew was really helpful and they served water, food, beverages with a pleasure. However Turkish Airlines failed the crisis management. The cabin crew performed the security demonstration three times because the aircraft was incoming new passengers as some other passengers preferred not to fly and leave. I had an intercontinental flight with KLM departing from Istanbul and I could tolerate 6 hours delay maximum, unfortunately I lost my intercontinental flight. A delay over 6 hours was out of my imagination. If the flight had been cancelled, I would not submit any complain and acccept the situation.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,M Penning,26th January 2016,"As a regular customer of Turkish Airlines I now have to write a review of the horrible experience we had flying back from Addis Abeba om Jan 2nd (plus the delay of our luggage on the way there on Dec 20th). It started on arrival in Addis on Dec 20th, none of our 5 bags had made it, it turned out that due to a change of plane there was not enough space in the hold and they had left most of them behind in Istanbul. Had to go back to the aiport the next day to get the bags, fortunately they were all there. Then on the way back our flight to Istanbul had a delay of more than 3 hours. We all boarded but then had to sit on the tarmac for 1.5 hours because they had to unload half of the luggage and told us it would arrive later. Of course we missed the connection in Istanbul and were greeted with total chaos due to the fact that extremely light snow had fallen. We had to queue for 4 hours together with hundreds of other people, no water, no food, many very angry people and no help whatsoever from any Turkish Airlines staff. To make a long story short: only because I insisted on getting on a flight that day were we lucky enough to be put on a flight to Amsterdam (not Brussels) which departed in total chaos as well. Many people were stranded for more than one night. We arrived in Amsterdam with 14 hours delay and no luggage. This was delivered to us after 5 days.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Jan Lutz Reimer,24th January 2016,"What a disappointment! We boarded the Turkish Airlines flight Kilimanjaro via Mombasa to Istanbul. This plane came from Istanbul - and was not cleaned during the stopover in Kilimanjaro.

The first stop would be Mombasa where the rest of the passengeres from Istanbul deboarded and others joined our flight back to Istanbul.

At Mombasa the flight crew changed and cleaning staff came on board to ""clean"" the plane while we had to wait on board. They just folded away the used blankets - so the new passengers could use it.

I checked my credit card and saw a charge of $824 for one ticket on my account and a pending charge of $3000 for the other 3 tickets purchased. I called the travel web site immediately since I know I am supposed to deal with them first. The rep for the travel web site contacted Turkish Airlines and kept me on hold for over an hour while he spoke with reservation agents and supervisors. Nobody could tell us exactly what happened or why. The agents simply stated the reservation was cancelled by the airline for some unknown reason. However, the reservation agents stated I would still be charged the full price for all four tickets as the tickets were non-refundable. Talk about unethical business practice. The airline screws up, cancels my booking without my consent or knowledge, and then charges me almost $4000. I understand charging the full price on a non-refundable ticket if the purchaser chooses to cancel, but how can the airline make that decision without any reason? The Turkish Airlines agent said nothing could be done on his end to rectify or correct the situation and that the travel web site agent would have to call a corporate sales office to work something out if it was possible. Mind you, nobody is saying I will get the situation taken care of. They are only saying I may be able to get the situation taken care of if I talk to the right people. I called Turkish Airlines myself the next day and was told the same thing: IF the situation can be fixed I would only be able to do so with the permission of the higher ups. When I asked for contact information for the corporate offices I was told to, ""look it up on the Internet and find it on my own."" Awesome customer service - just kidding. I did look up and call all of the corporate sales offices listed. None of them even put me through to a person. One had me on hold after the automated menu for 15 minutes and cut me off. Another simply had an auto message that stated, ""We cannot take your call. Goodbye."" And the others just rang. Realizing I may not resolve the issue before the pending charge of $3000 went through and a lot of time/red tape I promptly contacted my credit card company and explained the situation. The credit card company contacted Turkish Airlines and were given the same IFs and MAYs, so the credit card company went ahead and refunded me the $824 and promised to block the $3000 or refund it immediately if it went through before they could stop it. In other words book with caution as the customer service is awful and their practices can be very unethical.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ATL to LHR via IST,January 2016,,,,,,1.0,no,i havent actually flown turkish airlines as i havent been able to get so far as flying i booked a flight via a travel web site to fly with turkish airlines in may three days after receiving confirmation from the travel web site i checked the turkish airlines web site to see if i could choose my seats the airline booking number given to me showed my reservations were cancelled i checked my credit card and saw a charge of for one ticket on my account and a pending charge of for the other tickets purchased i called the travel web site immediately since i know i am supposed to deal with them first the rep for the travel web site contacted turkish airlines and kept me on hold for over an hour while he spoke with reservation agents and supervisors nobody could tell us exactly what happened or why the agents simply stated the reservation was cancelled by the airline for some unknown reason however the reservation agents stated i would still be charged the full price for all four tickets as the tickets were non-refundable talk about unethical business practice the airline screws up cancels my booking without my consent or knowledge and then charges me almost i understand charging the full price on a non-refundable ticket if the purchaser chooses to cancel but how can the airline make that decision without any reason the turkish airlines agent said nothing could be done on his end to rectify or correct the situation and that the travel web site agent would have to call a corporate sales office to work something out if it was possible mind you nobody is saying i will get the situation taken care of they are only saying i may be able to get the situation taken care of if i talk to the right people i called turkish airlines myself the next day and was told the same thing if the situation can be fixed i would only be able to do so with the permission of the higher ups when i asked for contact information for the corporate offices i was told to look it up on the internet and find it on my own awesome customer service - just kidding i did look up and call all of the corporate sales offices listed none of them even put me through to a person one had me on hold after the automated menu for minutes and cut me off another simply had an auto message that stated we cannot take your call goodbye and the others just rang realizing i may not resolve the issue before the pending charge of went through and a lot of timered tape i promptly contacted my credit card company and explained the situation the credit card company contacted turkish airlines and were given the same ifs and mays so the credit card company went ahead and refunded me the and promised to block the or refund it immediately if it went through before they could stop it in other words book with caution as the customer service is awful and their practices can be very unethical
Turkish Airlines,8.0,Erik Van den Haute,23rd January 2016,"Montreal to Ho Chi Minh City via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Value for your money, excellent quality of service. Flight attendants helpful, food was excellent, the seats were great and I did not experience a delay. No wifi on board. Inflight entertainment program is diverse. The only reason why I have stopped flying with Turkish airlines is because on the LH Miles&More program, to which they are affiliated, you only get 25 % of the miles you've actually flown, whatever your seating class is (I flew in business class and only got 2 % of the miles). The other setback is the fact that Istanbul Ataturk airport is one of their main hubs and this airport is just horrible - too small, totally unadapted to what ought to be a travelers experience today.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Sanjay Modak,23rd January 2016,"Malaga to Istanbul on TK1306 on 22 January 2016. Having recently acquired Elite status on Turkish Airlines, I was well aware that they are great in the air but pretty ordinary on the ground. Based on this flight with my wife today, I am ready to change that opinion. TK has become pretty ordinary both in the air and on the ground. I was confident that we would get exit row seats at check in at Malaga but were told all seats were taken. Luckily, I prevailed on the agent to give us a window and aisle with the middle seat vacant, which she did. There is no in-flight recognition by Turkish Airlines of a person's Elite status. My wife's seat did not recline. The crew were downright poorly trained. They did not do a seat belt inspection before take off and landing, window blinds remained closed as well. Food service was surly. The rice was cold, got standard kebabs that were awful. When I asked for a second helping of water, I was met with a glare. The crew spoke very poor English - something very common with Turkish Airlines cabin crews. When we landed in Istanbul after being in a holding pattern for 45 minutes, we were at the far remote end of the airport. The first bus left and we were left standing in freezing weather waiting for the next bus. Then the chaos of IST airport. All in all, a pretty dismal experience.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Chelsea Van Otterloo,22nd January 2016,"My flight Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Munich via Istanbul was cancelled and I was not notified. I found out once I got to the airport. I went through a brief security before going to check my bag in. The women who checked my bag than got extremely upset, borderline yelling at me, saying that I didnâ€™t go through the security area. It got to the point where the man who put me through security had to come and calm her down. Incompetent in the fact that the new flight they put me on had a 7 hour layover in Istanbul. The check in person, promised my bag would go to Munich, which of course it didnâ€™t - when I finally arrived in Munich and talked to the representative about my missing baggage, she said that since I was flying back to Minneapolis the next day instead of sending my bag to Munich they would just send it to Minneapolis, than have it delivered to my house, which was a lie. When I tried to track my luggage once I was home it didnâ€™t work. I called their customer service, who to be extremely kind, are inadequate at all and any part of their job, to try to locate my bag. The gentleman stated my bag arrived in Minneapolis on Sunday, it was lost on a Friday, and that it should be shipped to my house tomorrow. The next day comes and still no bag so I call back. The man tells me that my bag just passed customs and they have 24 hours to deliver it to me. I wait two days before calling back, quite annoyed at this point. The man I talked to this time tells me my bag went to Munich and thatâ€™s all he can see. So I let him know that other customer service staff I talked to were able to find out much more and he should get better at his job. He was than able to see my bag came to the US through Icelandair and is in MSP airport. I told him that everyone Iâ€™ve talked to has said it will be shipped to my house and when I would be able to expect it. He said they donâ€™t work with any delivery company in the US and that he isnâ€™t able to give me any more information. So when I asked him what I was supposed to do about getting my bag back and he responded with â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€, I donâ€™t think he was ready for the reaction he got. After showing him my frustration he was then able to locate the airline that my bag got to Minneapolis with and gave me their phone number. I called the airline and sure enough my bag had been sitting in their office all week. So after being lied to, by multiple people, that my bag would be shipped to my house, I had to make a 4 hour drive to the airport to pick it up over a week after it was lost. So donâ€™t fly this airline unless you want to be so upset that you write a short novel on how much you despise them.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,TLV to MUC via IST,January 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,my flight turkish airlines from tel aviv to munich via istanbul was cancelled and i was not notified i found out once i got to the airport i went through a brief security before going to check my bag in the women who checked my bag than got extremely upset borderline yelling at me saying that i didnt go through the security area it got to the point where the man who put me through security had to come and calm her down incompetent in the fact that the new flight they put me on had a hour layover in istanbul the check in person promised my bag would go to munich which of course it didnt - when i finally arrived in munich and talked to the representative about my missing baggage she said that since i was flying back to minneapolis the next day instead of sending my bag to munich they would just send it to minneapolis than have it delivered to my house which was a lie when i tried to track my luggage once i was home it didnt work i called their customer service who to be extremely kind are inadequate at all and any part of their job to try to locate my bag the gentleman stated my bag arrived in minneapolis on sunday it was lost on a friday and that it should be shipped to my house tomorrow the next day comes and still no bag so i call back the man tells me that my bag just passed customs and they have hours to deliver it to me i wait two days before calling back quite annoyed at this point the man i talked to this time tells me my bag went to munich and thats all he can see so i let him know that other customer service staff i talked to were able to find out much more and he should get better at his job he was than able to see my bag came to the us through icelandair and is in msp airport i told him that everyone ive talked to has said it will be shipped to my house and when i would be able to expect it he said they dont work with any delivery company in the us and that he isnt able to give me any more information so when i asked him what i was supposed to do about getting my bag back and he responded with i dont know i dont think he was ready for the reaction he got after showing him my frustration he was then able to locate the airline that my bag got to minneapolis with and gave me their phone number i called the airline and sure enough my bag had been sitting in their office all week so after being lied to by multiple people that my bag would be shipped to my house i had to make a hour drive to the airport to pick it up over a week after it was lost so dont fly this airline unless you want to be so upset that you write a short novel on how much you despise them
Turkish Airlines,9.0,Hannah Krispi,22nd January 2016,"Los Angeles to Tel Aviv via Istanbul and I've never flown Turkish Airlines, and after reading reviews I was nervous. At check in, I knew that one of my bags weighed more than the 50lb allowance, but the woman at the ticket counter was sweet enough to let it slide, and didn't charge me the extra fee. I flew with a friend who bought his ticket before mine, so we didn't have seats next to each other. The women at the gate were sweet enough to tell us there was a row in the back of the plane with nobody occupying it, so him and I were able to spread out amongst 3 seats and actually be comfortable. As soon as we took off they handed out coffee and drinks, little candies and a warm towel. My one issue is that by the time they got to our row, they had run out of the veggie option for dinner. I don't eat non-kosher meat so I ended up not eating, but that was my own fault for not requesting a special meal. The flight went by quickly, and the staff was very sweet and helpful. Even on the second flight, which was only an hour and a half long, we got served a dinner and drinks. The on-board chef even brought this little girl a cake out to the cabin because it was her birthday.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Cheryl Dilbeck,20th January 2016,"I just returned from a trip where I used Turkish Airlines, flying from San Francisco to Rome via Istanbul. I left San Francisco on January 1st. Check in went fine. The flight was fine. I had a layover in Istanbul and then on to Rome. I got to Rome and had no luggage. I was told it was left in Istanbul. The form was filled out and I was told they would deliver it to me either the next day or the day after that. This made me nervous as we were leaving for a cruise 4 days after my arrival in Rome. I didn't hear anything the first day. I tried to call them all through the second day and it was constantly busy, so I emailed them. They responded and said they did not have my luggage. I emailed every day and got the same reply every day for four days until we left on the cruise. Everything I needed for that cruise was in that bag - all the formal gowns, shoes, purses, etc. Once onboard the ship, they also tried to contact Turkish Airlines, but were not given any type of response. I called the airline during the cruise. I was told my claim had been closed and that my luggage had been delivered. When I questioned them about this as I had not received my luggage, they stopped responding to me. I called again and they told me to call a different number which I did. In the end, I was told to call four different numbers before they told me to call back to the original number. Each time I was told they could not help me. When I returned to Rome 16 days later, I went to the airport to try and find my luggage. After a considerable amount of time, they found it. A bit too late, however. Not having my luggage meant my daughter and I could not attend the three formal gala nights on the ship - the thing we were most looking forward to. Although we tried not to let the situation ruin the cruise, it definitely was not the vacation we had hoped for. For my return flight, Turkish Airlines cancelled the first flight and rebooked me on a flight four hours later. They caused me to miss my connecting flight. They were not concerned about my second leg, although it was booked on their airline. When I pushed them to get me home, they ended up booking me on British Airways. When I asked about compensation for the 1500 euros I had to spend on clothes, toiletries, etc, I was told sorry, fill out a form and someone will probably get back to you. So, here I am, not getting compensation and no one will respond to my emails or talk to me in person. Save yourself a ton of heartache and use a different airline.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,M Sheikh,20th January 2016,"Me and wife flew Turkish Airlines from Toronto to Lahore with a layover in Istanbul. The plane from Toronto to Istanbul was a little cramped for legroom, which was a 3x4x3 setting. I can't sit for very long and had to get up a few times and there was very little leg room to stretch my legs, my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me and I am not the tallest guy under 6'. Entertainment system was nice though, nice big screen with a lot of variety, the earbuds the airline provided are terrible for fitting, so just use yours with the adapter they provide. Touch screen is a little annoying as they don't have the best accuracy. One of the few airlines that provide care package that includes slippers, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and paste, wich is really nice. If you have little kids they will come around prior to take off with little baggies for them. Plane was clean overall, and the crew were overall very nice although English is not the best, making it hard to understand at times. Food was hit and miss. The main meal was decent, the dessert was great. Our next flight after this was from Istanbul to Lahore and the seating was roomier thats for sure. I think I would have enjoyed the flight more if not for the 4 hour layover that was compounded with a 4 hour delay with another 2 hour delay on the tarmac. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were nice once again. The food was again hit and miss as this time the main meal was not so great, dessert was nice though. Also whats nice is that you can ask for a sandwhich or dessert anytime during the flight or get up and go the the kitchen area and they have water or juice ready for you. Coming back, again the planes were clean and cabin crew were nice. Entertainment system was working all the way through. No delays at the airport this time. Overall I would say this is a decent airline, not the best. They have one big flaw and that is they are known for delays. I was told even before I flew that be prepared for this, I took this remark with a grain of salt as I know that it happens with all airlines.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,S Gabler,19th January 2016,"Some snow in Istanbul the day before my flight completely overwhelmed Istanbul airport and Turkish Airlines. My flight was 4 hours late out of Berlin. The bus in IST took another 15 minutes to leave the plane and my connecting flight to Johannesburg was nowhere signposted, and no ground staff around that could be asked. Maybe that was just bad luck, but than the nightmare (3 am) began. There was a queue of hundreds of people in front of a transfer desk which did not move at all! There seemed to be quite some ground staff behind the counter, but it was not clear what they did except walking back and forth ignoring passengers' pleads. Children were sleeping on the floor next to the line. After three hours I left my travel companion in the line and walked the airport to find another less crowded travel desk. Here ground staff was also walking away from exhausted passengers and their questions. Ground staff sent passengers to the other transfer desk to get rid of them. I persisted and finally got a boarding pass for a day later. No offer of food, accommodation or anything (7 am). The flight the following day was again 3 hours late and did not make up for the disaster. Filthy seat, uninterested crew and poor food. I don't support reviewers opinion on food.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,F Drexler,15th January 2016,"I had more than 20 flights on Turkish in the last 15 months, both international (European) and domestic. Out of those flights, half of them were on time with the other half were delayed by about an hour - only one had a four hour delay because of weather. As long as everything goes right, TK is a pretty good airline, but as soon as something goes wrong, their disaster management is a disaster itself and as a passenger you're usually left with no information about what's going on. Besides that, ground services are pretty slow as well and sometimes you're waiting for more than half an hour at the luggage belt. Seats on the narrowbody fleet are mostly okay while those on the A330s are pretty uncomfortable (didn't try the B777 so far). Turkish Airlines inflight catering is excellent and oustanding compared to most other airlines. When changing planes either at AtatÃ¼rk or Sabiha GÃ¶kcen airport, allow yourself some extra connecting time as flights are often a bit delayed and baggage handling and immigration (for domestic connections) sometimes takes ages. That extra time also increases the chance your luggage will make it on the connecting flight too.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Trevor Lewis,12th January 2016,"Like others have said here, the service by Turkish Airlines over New Year 2016 was appalling. I was flying Baghdad to London via Istanbul, and eventually arrived in London 31 hours late. The delays are bad enough and are far worse than can be justified by the bad weather alone - don't they know it snows sometimes! But it was the service and couldn't be bothered that made it so much worse. The level of service at the transfer desk for people who had missed connecting flights was so bad I thought it must be a hidden camera TV show. There were about 500 people in the queue, but only 4 or 5 people working. There was no security and on several occasions fights nearly broke out. This is not surprising as it was the early hours of the morning and people were tired. Any decent airline would have put on extra staff and kept people updated. They would have identified elderly passengers and people with young children and provided them with special service. I was in neither of these categories but would have understood the need. What I would not have understood was why it seemed Turkish passengers able to speak the language were frequently being given special treatment and allowed to jump the line. I was stood in this queue for 4 hours and not once did I see anyone that vaguely looked in charge. It was atrocious. But no one from Turkish Airlines seemed very bothered. Whilst TK might be cheap, you clearly get what you pay for! A lesson learned for me. TK claims to be one of the best airlines in Europe. Under EU law I would be entitled to some compensation I'm sure (even the bad weather can't justify such a terrible delays) but I doubt Turkish Airlines will live up to those standards.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,M Lueneburg,12th January 2016,"When things go wrong (which often they do when it comes to international air travel) Turkish Airlines simply are not equipped to handle it, nor do they have any interest. Their company is built with a front end, but no back end. Incompetent and rude staff hangs up and walks away in the face of concerned customers. Turkish Airlines uses confusion, bouncing their customers from call center to call center and desk to desk, playing them in circles until they tire and give up. Most of their flights connect through Istanbul airport and it is pure chaos. A shiny building and western style stores and restaurants do not make up for under experienced, under trained and the lack of an idea of what the concept of customer service is.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Vina Barahman,12th January 2016,"On January 1st, 2016, my flight from Tehran to Istanbul (TK875) was delayed for over 5 hours. The passengers, including myself did not receive any prior notification from the airline. Considering that many previous flights were cancelled due to weather conditions in Istanbul, the airline had surely predicted delay, but failed to inform the passengers, or make announcements in the airport. No information was provided from the Turkish Airline Staff, and finally when the plane took off and landed in Istanbul, we had to wait another 2 hours for the plane to be allowed to park. I had already missed my flight to New York (TK 003) which was scheduled for 7:25 on that morning. I understand that sometimes the weather conditions can cause delays and cancellations. What I am complaining about is the poor management, rude attitude of Turkish Airline Staff, and the very low-quality service provided by the staff in the airport. When I finally got out of the plane, we were confronted with a terminal full of stranded, confused, and unorganized passengers. There was no airport or Turkish Airlines Staff to guide us to the correct directions. Naturally we went to the Transfer Desk, to get information on how to get on the next available flight. More than 1500 passengers were jammed around the counter. There was not even one airport, security or airline staff to organize people and ask them to stand in line. Every one was just jammed in front of the counter. There was rarely enough space to breathe or move. The staff behind the transfer desk were clearly incapable of managing the situation. Instead of managing it, they also lost control and were shouting and banging their fists on the counter! After 2 hours of standing there, my passport was lost by one of the staff, and I had to wait for another hour for them to find it. Only to find out that all that trouble was for nothing, as I was told to go through passport control and then to the Check-in terminal, and go to Turkish Sales Office. This demonstrates the incapability and poor management of the airline and staff. They wanted to get rid of me by making me enter Turkey (through passport control) and go to check-in terminal, so that I am not their problem any more!

Turkish Airlines,1.0,R Godfrey,11th January 2016,"Appalling customer service! Due to snowfall in Istanbul, my flight from Taipei to Istanbul was delayed by 7 hours and I missed my connecting flight to London. The staff at Taipei had reissued my ticket for a later flight but this was cancelled at the last minute without any information. I was treated rudely by staff at the airport (both ground staff and Turkish Airlines reps) forced to queue up in 5 different queues for many hours and buy a Â£20 entry visa to Turkey to pass into a different section of the airport in order to get the airline to reissue my ticket. When they reissued it they told us that we had to rush as boarding time was in 30 minutes, so I prioritised getting to the gate over staying at the reissue desk to deal with the baggage information. We then discovered that the new flight was 10.5 hours late and they hadn't told us. Turkish Airlines caused more chaos at the boarding gate as they let people onto the plane who had only been issued with standby tickets and then had too many people trying to board the plane. After a 23 hour delay I reached London, only to be told by the Turkish Airlines lost baggage rep that despite being sure my baggage was not on the flight (given what happened in Istanbul and the fact that it was not found on the LHR system) I had to wait two hours by the belt while the staff shifted bags on and off it while everyone on my connecting flight stood around unable to see their bags. Finally I was allowed to fill out a lost baggage form. After three days I called to see if there was any progress and discovered they had mixed up the details of the bag's description.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Natalie Tan,10th January 2016,"London to Singapore via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, and a 22 hour delay on the ground. Outbound to London, everything went excellent - service by attendants and minimal delays taking off and landing. When I fell asleep on the first leg from Singapore to Istanbul and couldn't find my glasses, the attendant was very helpful in searching for it, even ripping out the seat in case it was stuck there. Food was really good also, considering when I slept through meal service and by the time I woke up, the flight attendant told me that my meal wasn't fresh anymore so she gave me a business class vegetarian meal instead. However, on my inbound flight on New Year's Eve/day, everything was a mess! I showed up at Heathrow to hear of a flight delay. Supposedly 1 hour became four, then five hours due to snow. They could have updated the website or sent a courtesy email so I didn't have to spend 8 hours at the airport before take off. Landed in Istanbul after circling for 2 hours due to lack of landing spots and another 2 hours waiting on the runway. Missed my connecting flight of course, and had to queue for 2 hours to get rebooked and re-sorted out on my next flight back to Singapore. Total chaos there with 30 crying babies at any one time and very rude, sneaky men cutting in line and making offensive remarks when I didn't let them cut in behind/infront of me. Ground staff and customer service desperately need training on conflict resolution and soft skills. Finally got on my plane, yet after another 1:30 delay.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Matthew Caesar,8th January 2016,"Turkish Airlines from Cairo to Amsterdam via Istanbul, and the flight itself was fine once airborne, food and entertainment were standard. But the ground operation is shambolic. Our flight leaving Cairo was delayed for one hour. I understand that this happens and little can be done about it, but once we arrived in Istanbul there was zero assistance to help people make their onward transfers. There were no staff at the arrival gate to direct passengers or offer assistance to more elderly people who couldn't run (unlike ourselves- if we hadn't sprinted we wouldn't have made the next flight). We had to push to the front of the security line, whereas many other airlines escort you to the front if the connection time is tight. Our gate had just closed when we arrived, but still made the last bus to the plane. Although the plane then sat on the runway for another hour. In short, there may as well have been no ground staff in Istanbul they did so little. This would be semi-understandable in a small provincial airport, but this is their hub! To finish everything off, our bags were lost. They were eventually delivered to us 4 days later, soaking wet. Not damp - drenched.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ankur Khare,8th January 2016,"I would like to show extreme dissatisfaction on the service I received during my recent experience with Turkish Airlines while coming back from Athens to Nairobi via Istanbul. We were to get a flight from Athens to Istanbul around 22:05 and then a connecting flight to Nairobi from Istanbul on 00:55. Much to our surprise when we reach at Athens airport at around 6:00om we came to know that the flight has been canceled. When I asked why we have not informed on the number we have mentioned on the ticket they declined to answer and asked us to get into a flight which was scheduled at 7pm. I was travelling with my wife and my 2.5 years daughter we actually had to run for check-in, security check, immigration etc as airline staff asked us to rush to get into the flight. Finally we reached to the gate but flight started after 8:30pm. We could not understand why we had been rushed for the formalities with a small baby. When we reached Istanbul, we have been informed that flight is late and eventually it was announced with the gate around 3:40am. We got into the bus and we had been taken to the aircraft but we had not been allowed to go out of the bus for almost 45 mins. Later on we had been taken back to the terminal and asked to wait. When we asked for the reason first they said that the Nairobi Airport is closed due to heavy snow fall which was an utter lie and later on the staff informed us that there is no Crew for the aircraft and it will take some time. We waited at the terminal without any assistance from anyone, sitting on the floor with the baby till 11am, and then they announced that flight has been cancelled and asked us to contact transfer desk. At transfer desk we had been given the new boarding passes and had been asked that next flight will be 0050 in the night which mean the whole day. I requested to give us some assistance as we have a baby and its very cold, but they refused to assist me in any way and later on just asked me to go away from the counter which was very rude. Later I took my own visa and booked the hotel by myself to go out so that we can have some rest. Later on next day when we landed at Nairobi all of our baggage were missing and there were no information. I had to follow-up with airport authorities and Turkish Airlines office daily to get my bags on the 6th after 4 days. The airport staff did not have normal empathy.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Saz Shamsi,7th January 2016,"Houston to Mumbai via Istanbul return, flying Turkish Airlines for the first time. The outbound trip to India was smooth. But on the way back it was one of the mot horrific experience I had had. We checked in on time as per the rules from Mumbai. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. We inquired with he ground staff will we get the connecting flight to Houston from Istanbul, and they said yes. So we were on the way to Istanbul. The flight arrived late. There was nobody at the gate to let us know what we should be doing as your flight connections are not there. We went through the security again and by the time we reached the gate for Houston, they had closed the gate. When inquired with the person there he said gate closed now you go and look yourself what to do. We had no clue where to go. We went inquiring all over the airport, and the people or the staff there kept us sending up and down and left and right. In the end we saw a counter and we stood in that line at least to get in touch with someone authentic to talk to. The lady did not speak proper English, but somehow we got out boarding pass done for the flight for the next day. Now the problem starts, we asked the lady for or hotel stay as we have not missed the flight due to our negligence, but it was due to the airlines mess up. She said go to the hotel counter, but to get there we had to pass through passport control and we needed visa. So we had to pay for the visa which was not acceptable to us, because by now we had lost faith in the staff and the people around.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,A Powers,7th January 2016,"This was the fourth of four legs of a return Turkish Airlines trip from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul, and one I'd like to forget. As a business class customer, priority boarding is promised, but at the gate it was a free-for-all. We eventually boarded but due to a computer problem we were delayed at the stand by almost 2 hours. The business class cabin was atrocious. The front of the cabin near the door was soaked in water, due to rain and a leaking sink. The taps in the sink were out of order so we had to rinse hands using bottled drinking water. Seats were economy style, with the middle seat free. When the passenger in front reclined, there was about 6-8 inches of room between the seat and my head, and the leg room was very cramped, knees touching the back of the seat in front once he reclined. There was no IFE, unless you call a sheet of sudoku puzzles entertainment. There were a few drop down screens which were used for the safety video. The screen was so dark it was impossible to see the images. First drink was served in a plastic cup. I am assuming that many of the passengers in business class were passengers from other cancelled flights, as our seat numbers were changed at the last minute (at the boarding gate). After take off, I waited until the seat belt light had gone off before unbuckling and going to the toilet. Once there the chief steward told me to sit back down as the light was still on - I can only assume he'd turned it off prematurely and then back on again after I'd walked to the toilet. I sat back down and waited for him to turn it off again. One passenger got up while the light was on and used the loo. I complained to the chief steward who said, he was ok to use it as he was about to turn the light off anyway. The same steward told another complaining passenger that if he didn't like the service he was more than welcome to leave the plane. I also complained that the lack of hygiene due to non-functioning washing facilities meant the plane wasn't fit for use. He dismissed my complaint. The leather covering of the raised seat arms were velcro-ed on, but the velcro had worn free leaving exposed dirty undersides. This is in no way business class standard - in fact it was less comfortable than economy (I travelled economy with a group to Kilimanjaro in October - that was a far more pleasant experience, despite a malfunctioning air con system leaving the cabin sweltering). The lounge at Istanbul is impressive, but be warned, the lack of their own lounges at other airports is a negative aspect of the experience. At Manchester, the Aspire lounge was in need of a good clean. At Kuala Lumpur the Premier Plaza lounge was packed to capacity, with lots of children and seats very close together. Wine is not included in the drinks service. Good points for business travellers include dedicated check in section and priority baggage loading and unloading. The lie-flat seats are ok (between Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul) and the food is ok. If you are looking for a true business class experience, I would highly recommend paying a bit more and going with another airline.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Business Class,IST to MAN,January 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,no,this was the fourth of four legs of a return turkish airlines trip from manchester to kuala lumpur via istanbul and one id like to forget as a business class customer priority boarding is promised but at the gate it was a free-for-all we eventually boarded but due to a computer problem we were delayed at the stand by almost hours the business class cabin was atrocious the front of the cabin near the door was soaked in water due to rain and a leaking sink the taps in the sink were out of order so we had to rinse hands using bottled drinking water seats were economy style with the middle seat free when the passenger in front reclined there was about - inches of room between the seat and my head and the leg room was very cramped knees touching the back of the seat in front once he reclined there was no ife unless you call a sheet of sudoku puzzles entertainment there were a few drop down screens which were used for the safety video the screen was so dark it was impossible to see the images first drink was served in a plastic cup i am assuming that many of the passengers in business class were passengers from other cancelled flights as our seat numbers were changed at the last minute at the boarding gate after take off i waited until the seat belt light had gone off before unbuckling and going to the toilet once there the chief steward told me to sit back down as the light was still on - i can only assume hed turned it off prematurely and then back on again after id walked to the toilet i sat back down and waited for him to turn it off again one passenger got up while the light was on and used the loo i complained to the chief steward who said he was ok to use it as he was about to turn the light off anyway the same steward told another complaining passenger that if he didnt like the service he was more than welcome to leave the plane i also complained that the lack of hygiene due to non-functioning washing facilities meant the plane wasnt fit for use he dismissed my complaint the leather covering of the raised seat arms were velcro-ed on but the velcro had worn free leaving exposed dirty undersides this is in no way business class standard - in fact it was less comfortable than economy i travelled economy with a group to kilimanjaro in october - that was a far more pleasant experience despite a malfunctioning air con system leaving the cabin sweltering the lounge at istanbul is impressive but be warned the lack of their own lounges at other airports is a negative aspect of the experience at manchester the aspire lounge was in need of a good clean at kuala lumpur the premier plaza lounge was packed to capacity with lots of children and seats very close together wine is not included in the drinks service good points for business travellers include dedicated check in section and priority baggage loading and unloading the lie-flat seats are ok between kuala lumpur and istanbul and the food is ok if you are looking for a true business class experience i would highly recommend paying a bit more and going with another airline

Turkish Airlines,1.0,E Christy,5th January 2016,"Tel Aviv to Accra via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines does not have its act together. My family was stuck in Istanbul for four days. The first day, we missed our connecting flight because 1 inch of snow caused our flight to be five hours delayed. We wandered around the airport for several hours, looking for employees that could not be found easily. When employees were located, they did not have accurate information to let us know how to deal with our problem. When we finally figured out where we needed to go to get our ticket reissued for the next flight (the following day), we had to wait in a 5-hour line to have it reissued. At the end of the line, our ticket was begrudgingly reissued by rude employees. The flight they rebooked us on was cancelled the next day. That led to more 3-5 hour lines and more rude Turkish Airlines employees. When we came back the next day for our flight, it was overbooked, and they did not get us on the flight. Finally, on day four we were put on a flight and actually arrived at our destination and they lost our luggage. The main problem is that in Istanbul they isolate all of their functions. You cannot go to one desk and get all of the help and information you need. Each desk only has one function and they are not even familiar with the functions of every other desk.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Danny Rosenberg,4th January 2016,"Beijing to Barcelona via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. When we arrived at the airport for our 12:50 am flight, we went to check in to learn our flight had been delayed until 430am because the crew had worked overtime. At that point I asked why weren't we notified so we could have stayed at our hotel longer and not have had to sleep at the airport. Their response was that they still had to check everyone in at the normal time, which I find absurd. After waiting for two hours they offered us sandwiches. At 4.30 the pilots had arrived and boarded the plane, remember we were told we'd be taking off at 4.30. 20 minutes later the cabin crew arrived. We didn't start boarding until 5.20. The plane didn't take off until 6, an hour and a half later than what we were told it would be. What bothered me more is that at no point were we apologized to for the inconvenience.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Helge Reitz,4th January 2016,"After snow fall on New Years Eve, on Jan 1st we checked prior driving to the airport the airport departure information and found no information on delays or any problems whatsoever. We then drove through beautiful weather to the airport. There we found total chaos: About 20 to 30 flights had been cancelled. At 11.00 our flight (TK0786 to Tel Aviv at 12.20) was marked as cancelled too, almost all other flights where delayed. The Turkish Airline transfer desk had kilometer-long lines, and after waiting and pushing for many hours, all they did there was copy passports. Then we were sent to the ticket counter, again km long lines. We did finally arrive in Tel Aviv with 11 hours delay. But our luggage had been lost. Now, 3 days later, still no news about our luggage. And guess what, the service number of Turkish Airlines in Tel Aviv is engaged constantly. Durning the 10 hours of queing and being pushed around there was no anouncement of appology, no public appeal through the intercom system, no drinks were offered, no assistance to disabled people was arranged, no special treatment for families with pregnant woman or little children was offered. Turkish Airlines did not seem to make any effort whatsoever to put some substance to their solgan ""we are the most popular airline"". They let their own few staff members who were trying to handle the situation down badly.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Rudd,4th January 2016,"Our Turkish Airlines flight from Mombasa to Istanbul (via Addis Ababa) was delayed. On arrival into Istanbul we had to queue for 2 hours to collect our boarding pass for our connecting flight. This meant we missed our connecting flight to London Heathrow. When we finally arrived at the front of the desk the man was very unhelpful and arrogant. He said he could not help us and that we must go to the ticket sales desk to rebook our flight. The process of getting a boarding pass should not take more than 2 hours! We were told that the flight had gone without us and that we must purchase a visa and exit the airport to go to the ticket sales desk to get a new ticket. After a further hour we arrived at the ticket sales office. We then queued for a further 4 hours (where people were fainting, arguing and children were being sick) we finally reached the desk. We were told that there were no flights to anywhere in the UK for 2 more days. Our return destination was not possible so we had to change our return destination to Manchester. After this, we were told we could collect our luggage from the lost luggage area. After waiting a further hour, the staff told us it was impossible to get our bags and were unhelpful. As a result we still have no luggage. After this we had to join the hotel booking queue which took another hour. We have been left with no luggage, no clothes, no toothbrush, no toiletries and no warm clothes in a snowy environment. The customer service for Turkish Airlines at Istanbul airport has been the worst experience of our lives. The airline have been completely disorganised, unhelpful and at times very rude. The staff are unprepared and spoke minimal English. People should not have to wait in queues for hours without being provided water or seating. People with children were not assisted appropriately. We were treated like dogs for a problem that could have been sorted appropriately and efficiently. We hope that our flight tomorrow is on time. We have missed 2 days of work which we want compensation for. We also have a car parked at Heathrow airport (our original destination) which we will have to try and get as our destination was changed due to their incompetence. We will never fly with Turkish Airlines again. I cannot believe they have been voted the best airline in Europe. The way they have treated people is disgusting and an outrage.

After about 35 mins, I gave my ID and I was told, even without apologies, that my possibilities to board were 50-50, because I was late to check-in, and there were some extra tickets sold. Further explanations were not given, but my guess is that they thought on this bad weather some people will not make it to the airport (as it happened ) so why can't we sell some extra tickets for more profit? I arrived at the gate and I gave my non-seat Boarding Pass, and I was been told to wait. I discovered that there were 3 more people with the same problem as mine.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ayse Zarakol,2nd January 2016,"I've just had the worst experience of my traveling life, and it is not over. We (a couple and 5 year old) were due to fly out from Istanbul to London Gatwick on Wednesday with Turkish Airlines. Due to what would be a manageable snow storm elsewhere, we were first kept in the airport with a four hour delay. The area we were kept in was very crowded and not equipped to handle thousands of passengers they were bussing to the planes. Then we were kept in the plane for seven hours. Finally we were let off the plane. Once we got back to the airport we had to pass through customs and saw that they had made no allowances for the mess they themselves had created. Nobody seemed to know where we should go or what we should do. Then it was more waiting in various lines to get rebooked. Next day our flight was cancelled again. More lines and hours of waiting to rebook. Turkish Airlines has this ""amazing"" system where one cannot get rebooked at a check-in counter and instead has to go to a special desk called ""ticket sales"" to get rebooked. There are at most 10 of these desks throughout the airport, which were trying to process thousands of passengers yesterday. So after Turkish Airlines cancels your flight, they make you wait in line for hours for the privilege of getting rebooked.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Kim,14th December 2015,"We left from Seoul and while flying over Tibet the captain announced that the right wing engine was malfunctioning and that we had to emergency land in Beijing. After waiting on the taxiway for more than an hour and in the airport terminal for almost 2 hours, we were taken to a hotel with no english speaking staff. Because we didn't have a chance to exchange currency, and because it was past dinner time at the hotel, we could not eat. The airline staff also refused to answer questions regarding the plane or when the next flight would leave. The next day, after deciding that no help would come for us to the hotel, some passengers got cabs individually and went to Beijing International Airport, only to wait for another 3 hours until the staff showed up. There were over 100 passengers at the desk by then, and we demanded explanation. The 2 persons who came to represent Turkish Airlines just told us to give them our passports and final destination. My itinerary was 6 days in Turkey and 7 days in Italy. The staff took me and my wife to Lufthansa to board a plane which flew to Munich and then to Venice. They told us that our non-refundable hotel reservations in Turkey would be compensated by Turkish Airlines. That was the one question the staff answered. After we arrived in Venice, our bags did not arrive. They did not arrive for the whole 2 weeks which was the length of our honeymoon. After returning to Seoul, I tried calling Turkish Airlines.

The airplane supposed to be used for that particular flight was normally, as every day, an A330-200 with their Business seat flat-bed, angle-free, 2x2x2 configuration. But unfortunately, in late minute, their plan changed. Probably due to the fact that the plane was not full at all (even the replacement plane, A321). The big dissapointement was when we entered this A321. It was a very old one, in 3x3 configuration, with no real business seat. So even we paid really expensive business class ticket, we got seated in Economy Seat, with the ""chance"" that we were only 2 person in a 3 seat row. But the leg-space was still really tight, and seat really narrow. Bad service, old plane, no screen or inflight entertainment, really bad seating for that price. In this case, I'm really wondering why paying 4 times the price of an economy ticket, while you get offered the exactly same service?!

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Selim Ercan,10th December 2015,"I flew 10 international and 2 domestic flights with Turkish Airlines this year and they will likely be my last. Sure their planes are nice and new, but their service is getting worse every time I fly. Their customer service (online or via phone) has been pretty bad for a while, but now it's spreading to their in-flight services. The hostesses behave rudely to passengers raising their voices. They don't come right away when you push the call button. I waited an hour to get a cup of water on my last flight. This is unacceptable. The food on board used to be better. In the past I would actually look forward to eating it, but lately their food quality is slipping. On my last trip I wanted chicken but they ran out by the time they came to my row. Istanbul Ataturk Airport is very poorly operated. We are constantly transported by bus to and from the planes rather than boarding at a gate. My last trip it was raining and we got wet getting off the plane. The in-flight entertainment is decent. They have plenty of movies to watch, but not so many TV shows. I've flown so many times in 2015 that I actually ran out of things to watch.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,L Heybridge,7th December 2015,"Gatwick to Seoul via Istanbul. My husband had flown with Turkish Airlines recently and had glowing reports, I was pleased to have had a similarly good experience. Seats in economy were very comfortable in all sectors and it was great to have IFE for the IST-LON routes. On our flight out, a passenger appeared to have passed away on the inbound IST-LGW flight so the flight was delayed by an hour. No information was given at LGW, but I was one of the few who might have figured out what had happened and I expect that most passengers would be more comfortable not knowing. Crew were welcoming and friendly but there were no forced smiles. It couldn't have been a great day for them but they showed utmost professionalism throughout the journey. Food was excellent, there was plenty to drink, flight was full. Not many toilets for Economy passengers, but they were well maintained and kept clean. Many of the passengers would not have made their connecting flights. I had a two hour transit window which was reduced to one hour. I walked purposefully (did not need to clear any security for this particular journey) and got to my gate as passengers were boarding. It was a long walk. I do not recommend a transit time of less than 2 hours with Turkish Airlines here. The next flight was also very full in economy but my seat was extremely comfortable and I appreciated the foot rests. Entertainment options were even more extensive than on my earlier flight. Food, again, was fantastic. I doubt any airline gives you better food in economy (better than some Business Class meals I've had). Unfortunately, about a third of the way into the flight I became ill. The crew swooped into action, called amongst the passengers for medical assistance and I had my pulse and blood pressure checked. Business class was a lot less busy than Economy and I was isolated from other passengers in a business class chair that had been turned into a bed for me. The crew kept a check on my throughout the rest of the flight and kept me hydrated. The worst of my illness passed by the time we arrived over South Korea and I took myself back to my Economy chair for landing. Thanks to the crew, I was left in a fit state to continue my journey (just needed an extra sick bag for the road). The flight back was less eventful but standards were just as high. The flight from ICN to IST was delayed by an hour. Again, I had a two hour transit window that was halved and I arrived at my gate for the IST-LHR flight as it was boarding. I really enjoyed my flights and appreciated the care and service I was given. I don't hesitate to recommend this airline but I do stress how important it is to have a long enough transit window to deal with an unforeseen delay.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Tom Payne,22nd November 2015,"Chicago to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. This was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance. I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people. I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers. I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul. But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it. The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will. It is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service.",,Business,Business Class,ORD to DUS via IST,November 2015,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no,chicago to dusseldorf via istanbul this was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance i looked forward to the flight because i love turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the turkish people i flew to istanbul and noticed i was invisible to turkish airlines staff they focused their attention on their turkish customers i had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it after about an hour on my knees i finally asked someone to hang it they also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow blanket etc they made the beds of their turkish clientele but my seat did not even have this packet nor was i asked if i wanted my bed to be made the food however was excellent from istanbul to dusseldorf i experienced something ive only experienced in third-world travel flies a host of flies bothered us the entire way as they delivered trays of food flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays the return trip was worse flies again plagued us from dusseldorf to istanbul but the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes she asked me if i wanted an aisle seat and i said yes i then added i flew bulkhead from istanbul to dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again her response of course imagine my shock when i discovered my hour flight from istanbul to chicago was a bulkhead middle seat what sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler would you like an aisle seat and then give them a middle seat or acknowledge the bulkheads lack of desirability and then placing the passenger there for hours turkish airlines should come with this warning no matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight it is not worth it the customer processing system went out of order in istanbul prior to the flight to chicago every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper so they held up the boarding of the flight and sent down segments normally you would expect the business class to go first followed by the business class not in turkey the most important quality a passenger can have is being turkish so the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in istanbul meaning about of the first boarders were locals then once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes complete chaos reigned if i can avoid flying turkish airlines i will it is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service

This was the second time I flew with Turkish Airlines the same route and the second time we left more than 2 hours late from Nuremberg. Thus the connecting flight was impossible to be reached in time as you have to cross Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Airport and pass again baggage checks and passport control. The ground staff was inpolite and not communicative - they just issued another ticket for the next plane and surrendered it without a single word. I wrote to Turkish Airlines and explained the situation - they would check and come back to me. Reminding them about the outstanding complaint several times I received an unreadable standard excuse 4 weeks later and they would be glad to welcoming me again. Talking to friends who also came via Turkish Airlines from other German destinations I found that they encountered the same problems at this Airport.

Boarding process was painful, as the ground services staff tried to squeeze as many passengers onto the bus as possible.

The onboard experience was okay apart from the very limited entertainment. The inflight entertainment had only a few movies and tv shows and didn't reflect the usual offering.

Also, when your glass or cup is empty, it is usually promptly taken away (instead of offering a refill). Because of its competitive price, Turkish Airlines is definitely worth considering, but make some allowances. Check in in Istanbul is totally chaotic.

The ladies in their customer service call center are unhelpful and one was very rude. I had to call several times due to many issues, and each phone call was much longer than it should be because of the language barrier and their unwillingness to simply do their job. The business lounge at Istanbul airport is beautiful - made ugly by the rude staff. Extremely unhelpful.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Bobby Mphia,26th October 2015,"I have always been a frequent traveler with Qatar Airways whenever possible. But this summer me and my wife decided to travel to Istanbul for a week long holiday and decided to try out Turkish Airlines. What a bad choice it was. Right from the start of the journey, all the flights were late. From CPH to IST, it was delayed by 3 hours and no explanations were provided. However it brought us to Istanbul in one piece and along with the luggage, so that was a bit or relief. The seat was good but the food was barely ok, as I don't think they were particularly fresh. But it was on our return trip they broke all the expectations. To begin with, the flight was delayed again by 3 hours. The ground staff were very rude and barely spoke English. We had some fragile items, which were properly packed, tagged and labeled. In addition to that, we had put on the Turkish Airlines fragile stickers as required by the ground staff. But it never arrived with us to CPH. After investigating, it was told to us that it was not loaded and will arrive next day. But when it arrived, it was not in one piece. One third of the things were broken and there were clear sing of mishandling and wear and tears as the package was scraped. We took pictures of the broken materials and the ripped package instantly in front of the delivery person and sent it to Turkish Airlines. But alas, it was of no use. They ignored our complaint. Not even replying to our email initially. We tried to call to the HQ in Istanbul and then they said they will look into it and later replied that they dont have any responsibility towards it, as it is fragile item so the owner bears the risk of any damage and not the Airlines.

Service on the outbound flight was good and the larger premium economy seats which recline allowed us to sleep on this night time flight. Food was above average. However, the return flight was not nearly so happy. The flight out of Istanbul was delayed (which happens) and there was chaos in the waiting hall. Then it turned out that the aircraft wasn't able to come to the bridge which meant we had to be bussed to the plane which was in the cargo area a long distance from the terminal. The ground crew never explained to us why the airplane couldn't come to the bridge. So all of the passengers had to walk to the end of the bridge and down fairly steep metal stairs to the tarmac.

We were allocated seats for the second leg in row 29. On boarding the second flight I noticed that one set of basinettes seats were occupied by a man and woman who had no child with them.

Loading at Entebbe was late and when got down to the airport apron a Turkish Airlines agent rushed up and asked what we were doing. The answer was, unsurprisingly, boarding the plane. He informed us all abruptly we should not be boarding and ushered us back to the door area we had just come out of. He told us to wait. It was pouring with rain. After 30 mins the passengers were wandering around the apron area (which was unsafe) while the aircraft was still being prepared (passengers who started their journey in Kigali had a one-and-half hour trust at Entebbe on the plane - that must have been a joy.

I asked for my seat area to be tidied up - I was glared and growled at by the steward. ""Do it yourself"" he said - I suggested that he should tidy the seat area for his passengers.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,M Grol,15th October 2015,"It had been a long time I flex Turkish Airlines. I must say it was quite the disappointment. From ZRH to IST, I was in a plane which had an interior that must have come from the early 80's. Staff not very friendly and they do not speak very good English either. Food was good. Next leg was IST to ICN. Boarding was dramatic. Entering a bus that was fully packed. Privileges for Business Class passengers were absent and after a long bus ride, you can walk up to the plane. Business Class setup is 2-3-2, so luckily I did not book late which most likely would have resulted in being boxed in in the middle. Staff and food was consistent with the first leg.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Robert Barta,13th October 2015,"We took off from Istanbul airport with 4 hours delay, instead of at 2:05AM, finally at around 6:00AM. But the main problem was the communication about the delay at the airport. They officially announced the 1 hour delay but when after the after 2 hours delay nothing happened the admitted the longer delay without saying anything about the cause. So during the whole 4 hours period of delay the passengers were kept at the gate without saying even a word of apology, without offering even the drink for refreshment, without even saying about the length and the reason of delay. On top of this the entertainment system onboard the plane was working just for the some passengers. The others were unlucky. We were a family of four and just 2 of us the system worked.

In all about 15 passengers were involved. The crew did nothing. No crew member even appeared to this mayhem unfolding and putting safety at risk. To make matters worse the cabin lights had been turned off (it was an early evening arrival) and the cabin was in semi darkness. These passengers commenced to move down the aircraft luggage in hand while the plane was moving to the gate. Finally, the head steward decided to issue a direction to them to return to their seats.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Simon Bush,10th October 2015,"Turkish Airlines has good food, but the service could do with a bit of revamp. A smile in any language goes down well. Seems that Turkish Airlines depends on surly service. My luggage did not make it through the chaotic transfer at Istanbul Ataturk Airport and is still to arrive at Entebbe. The transfer at Istanbul is a shambles that does not reflect well on the airline or the image of Turkey. The first flight from London to Istanbul was a half full business class cabin with a flat bed. The six hour flight from Istanbul to Entebbe was in a very small and cramped business class cabin. No flat bed which was odd given the length and timing of the flight. On both flights crew vanished behind their curtain (which seemed important for them to keep firmly closed) to talk loudly after the food and drink service only to show their faces again when getting the plane ready for landing (curtain pulled back at the very possible last minute). Not sure the point of the Chef on board. Turkish Airlines use of the United Airlines lounge at Heathrow Terminal 2 which is lucky, given the 15-20 minute walk from the security area, near the TK boarding gate. No time to sample the lounge at Ataturk Airport given the botched transfer. Turkish Airlines ground handling agent at Entebbe Airport are well used to, it seems, dealing with multiple passengers with lost luggage. Three agents working on Turkish Airlines baggage issues at 3am! Not too sure how the airline wins awards.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,L Davis,6th October 2015,"From boarding to deplaning, this is a very good airline. From reservations to boarding however, this is a poor airline. Shortcomings include a very weak online reservation system in that I could not select seats. I had to call three times to select seats - unacceptable! When you arrive or depart from IST, you may be transported to/from your plane via a bus. Upon arrival or deplaning of your aircraft, you have to navigate a flight of stairs exposed to the weather. Despite what airline staff tell you, if you are connecting through IST, you must leave yourself a bare minimum of 90 minutes to make your flight. Due to the possible great distance from one gate to another, at least 15 minutes transit time from your plane to the gate via their bus system, the lack of people movers, and the overcrowding of the airport itself, you risk missing your flight if you allow less than 90 minutes between flights. TK does not use a rope system similar to the one you encounter passing through security, at their check in desk and you can wait a very long time for what should be a quick process. Personal experience with connecting from arrival until I reached Gate 226 for my connecting flight (very last gate in the airport) took 50 minutes and I was allotted 60 minutes.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Rafiqul Islam,6th October 2015,"We have been travelling Turkish Airlines business class from New York/Boston to Dhaka via Istanbul for the last three years. The timing suits us, and service had also been reasonably good. But the service had been going downhill for the last year. You donâ€™t get a boarding bridge at Istanbul, the airport is so chaotic. On June 4, 2015 we were scheduled to fly from Boston. We had fully confirmed business class tickets. When we arrived at the airport, we saw an incredible scene. The passengers and check in crew were shouting at each other, very close to an all out fight. Apparently, the airline had overbooked the business class and was unable to provide seats to us all. It got very ugly and the Turkish Airlines supervisor was trying to persuade passengers to either fly economy class or fly the next day. Very ugly situation because so many people were involved. They offer discount online and overbook, hoping there will be some last minute cancellation. When there are no cancellations, people are asked to fly economy or fly next day. Apparently, these happen quite frequently in Boston. Anyway, to get to my experience, we did not get our seat. They offered us hotel and flew us the next day. Faced with no alternative, we had to accept their offer and we flew the next day. Turkish Airlines also promised token compensation of money back, and double mileage earned.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Amnon Freund,5th October 2015,"We flew Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt with a layover in Istanbul. First the service on the flight was terrible, I accidentally spilled hot coffee on my wife, the stewardess noticed it but couldnt care less (although it was burning hot, and my wife yelled), when I asked her for a napkin to clean the spilled coffee, she handed me 1 napkin without even asking if there is anything else she could do to help. That was only the beginning, due to late departure from Tel Aviv, we arrived late to Istnbul just to see our connecting flight push out of the gate (15 minutes earlier to take off time), we went to the Turkish Airlines desk, who told us we need to go to the transfer desk. When we got to the transfer desk, the clerk told us that we have been rebooked to a flight at 04:10, which meat that we had 9 hours wait. when I asked if they will give us a hotel room till the flight, we were informed that only if the delay is over 10 hours do they supply a hotel room. I asked to speak to a manager on duty to explain that the wait is 9 hours at night, we went to speak to a staff member but after letting us wait for 10 minutes he informed us that he is not a manager, and if we want to speak to one we need to go through immigration to the Turkish Airlines desk they will help us. We did so only to realize that there was nothing there. We needed to go back through immigration and went again to the desk to try to understand what we are expected to do in the 9 hours wait.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Nadeem Khan,24th September 2015,"Karachi to Istanbul to Chicago in February 2015: We took off on time. Istanbul Airport had snow and was shut, so re-routed to Ankara. Passengers from our flight were the first to arrive at the Ankara Transit Lounge and then came passengers from 7 other re-routed flights. Food was scarce. One sandwich and one cold drink in 10 hours. Snack store made money hand over fist. The worst part was that there were hardly any Turkish Airlines officials available to tell us that what the plan was. There were no public announcements about how long we will be there. People started to get angry not because they were stuck at the airport, they were angry because the Airline staff never bothered to tell us how long we will be stuck there. After about 10 hours of being in the transit lounge, they finally said we will be taken to a hotel for overnight stay. They said they will pay for the visa fee. We finally were herded to immigration and found out that we have to pay the visa fee and file for a reimbursement later. Some people had no $$s cash with them. Some people were very angry as $40 was a huge sum of money for them. After another two hours in the immigration line, we got our visas and were told that there are buses outside waiting to take us to hotel. Well, that was too good to be true. It took another 2.5 hours of standing in line in front of the terminal exit waiting for the buses to arrive/load. Finally we were got into a bus. On a positive note, the hotel was nice and dinner was free. At the hotel, one of the hotel staff told us that the passengers will have two choices in the morning: a 4 hour bus/train ride back to Istanbul airport. Once there, they will try to find a flight to get us out of the country, or possibly get us on a flight leaving from Ankara airport.

Multiple food courses. Plating from the food trolley was done very professionally. Excellent food, probably the best in the industry. Good flavor and quantities.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Ann Watters,23rd September 2015,"The cabin temperatures were just right on my Turkish Airlines flights. VCE-IST was efficient, on time, gate agent fine. Second leg from Istanbul to San Francisco was a delayed departure. I looked around the Turkish Airlines lounge at Istanbul and it is as described, two floors, huge, lots going on, lots of food service. However, if flying Turkish Airlines you are going to get lots of food on the plane anyway so probably most helpful if you are using the lounge when flying nonbiz and have a pass/status. I personally prefer a smaller, quieter lounge but there's definitely the service here. Security for the connection to SFO from IST was heavier, including carry on search/testing and wanding everyone at the gate, so allow plenty of time at the gate. Lie flat seat was excellent, good bedding. I would never want the middle seat in business even with the good seat, and the Turkish Airlines Boeing 777 has middle seats in business class.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,L Karungi,21st September 2015,"I should have trusted the Turkish Airlines reviews - it's clearly part of the customer experience with this airline, misplacing/mishandling customer's luggage.

Uganda to London, 5/5 suitcases missing, 1 month later, 1 suitcase is still to be found. The food was excellent and the customer service was okay (I had to beg for a bottle of water when i was dehydrated from being in istanbul too long), but no matter how good the in-flight experience is, nothing defeats the purpose of an international flight more than getting there and finding your luggage didn't arrive with you.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Daphne Yeh,15th September 2015,"Horrible service, will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I took a flight from Lyon to Taipei with a connecting flight in Istanbul. I was informed at check-in that my flight had been delayed 4 hours, upon further check at the airline's desk, I was informed that I had a choice to stay in Istanbul for 24 hours as there were no connecting flight due to the delay. The airline would provide lodging, transport to the hotel, and I only needed to apply for an evisa online. Up to this point the service had been slow but fine. This attitude had a 360 degree turn in Istanbul. As soon as I landed in Istanbul, a few passengers who would be staying at the provided hotel, myself included, tried to look for a way out of the airport and onto the shuttle bus. We were met with inefficient and unreasonable staff, my politeness was returned with unbelievably rude attitudes. We turned from counter to counter, with the staff giving us unhelpful directions. A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave. Still, I was lucky as I found out the next day, a few of the passengers had to stay at the airport (for more than 16 hours) because they had not been informed to apply for a visa in Lyon and after running around the airport once again trying to apply for a visa, was met with unhelpful staff and contradictory directions. Sadly, this was not the end of my nightmare. The insulting attitudes of the staff I had to bear when I asked for a certificate of delay at the airport before my flight was appalling. Again, I was turned from counter to counter (the staff seems not to have the ability to direct one to the right counter at first request) At my last stop I requested the certificate and explained my delay. Shockingly, the staff with scorn and disdain replied that my flight was not delayed, why or how did I believe it to be delayed? If it hadn't been delayed I would have been on my flight that second, not running madly around the airport struggling with airline staffsthat seems to despise and absurdly question the intellect of their customers. The breaking point came when he asked me why my flight had been delayed. No, the staff did not have the courtesy to tell me why my flight was delayed but had the audacity to put that question upon me. I have been very disappointed with Turkish Airlines on this horrendous trip. Through my encounters with the airline staff I felt insulted and laughed at.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,D Tolla,8th September 2015,"The worst travel experience I had and I swear I will not fly Turkish Airlines again. I was traveling with my 9 year old daughter from Venice to Addis Ababa via Istanbul and there was a delay in our flight from Venice to Istanbul, which resulted in missing our connecting flight to Addis. This was not that surprising as I found out later it is very very likely to miss your connecting flight when you fly Turkish Airlines. Like everybody else, we went to the transfer desk and they put us on the next flight which is one day later. Next to the transfer desk there is a a place to make a free phone call to inform your family about the delay. This is where the trouble began, since there is a delay on almost every connecting flight they provide a single phone for all those people and there was a very long queue. We waited for about 2 hours on the queue and when there was only one person in front of me, this women came with one of the desk attendants and he let her to cut in front of me. I didn't think that was right and I complained and as he result he disconnect the telephone line and shut down everything, without caring even a bit about all those people on the line. The next step was to get a hotel to spend the night, which is located outside the airport and we need a visa to go out. The visa can be bought inside the airport but they refuse to accept our Ethiopian passport, and they demanded a resident permit from Italy. I had the permit card, with my daughters name included on the same card, it is the Italian immigration law that minors do not get independent permit card, but their name is included on one of the parents card. The Turkish police refused this and told me that I can get the visa but my daughter can't, which in my opinion a stupid police. When I try to get an explanation for such stupid rule, every one of them was giving me the same answer ""I don't know"". So we spent 24 hours inside the Istanbul airport, buying food with our own money. Even the people working at the food courts are very rude. The next day we boarded the aircraft on time but it took off 6 hours late, they even changed the entire cabin crew at one point. So we had a 30 hours delay in total. On our return flight we again missed our connecting flight but this time we waited only 3 hours for the next one. So you be the judge isn't Turkish Airlines the worst?",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Addis Ababa via IST,August 2015,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,the worst travel experience i had and i swear i will not fly turkish airlines again i was traveling with my year old daughter from venice to addis ababa via istanbul and there was a delay in our flight from venice to istanbul which resulted in missing our connecting flight to addis this was not that surprising as i found out later it is very very likely to miss your connecting flight when you fly turkish airlines like everybody else we went to the transfer desk and they put us on the next flight which is one day later next to the transfer desk there is a a place to make a free phone call to inform your family about the delay this is where the trouble began since there is a delay on almost every connecting flight they provide a single phone for all those people and there was a very long queue we waited for about hours on the queue and when there was only one person in front of me this women came with one of the desk attendants and he let her to cut in front of me i didnt think that was right and i complained and as he result he disconnect the telephone line and shut down everything without caring even a bit about all those people on the line the next step was to get a hotel to spend the night which is located outside the airport and we need a visa to go out the visa can be bought inside the airport but they refuse to accept our ethiopian passport and they demanded a resident permit from italy i had the permit card with my daughters name included on the same card it is the italian immigration law that minors do not get independent permit card but their name is included on one of the parents card the turkish police refused this and told me that i can get the visa but my daughter cant which in my opinion a stupid police when i try to get an explanation for such stupid rule every one of them was giving me the same answer i dont know so we spent hours inside the istanbul airport buying food with our own money even the people working at the food courts are very rude the next day we boarded the aircraft on time but it took off hours late they even changed the entire cabin crew at one point so we had a hours delay in total on our return flight we again missed our connecting flight but this time we waited only hours for the next one so you be the judge isnt turkish airlines the worst
Turkish Airlines,8.0,Derek Salter,7th September 2015,"Paris to Cape Town via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. New plane on both legs. Excellent entertainment system and good leg room. Check in easy at Paris and boarding done smoothly. Cabin crew on both flights very attentive, bottle of water for overnight flight and answered call bells quickly. Food passable. Main problem is at Istanbul airport. It is now very busy and can feel chaotic. For both flights there - landing and taking off - we were bussed to and from the airport. This meant a long trip to and from the plane. The gate for the bus to the plane has a small waiting area, no clear means of lining up and no priority given to any passengers at all whether they were elderly, had small children or were in business.

While I was waiting for dinner to be served I laid flat the table for the cabin attendant to place the meal on it. I was sitting by the window and I fell asleep, for maximum two minutes. The passenger sitting in the aisle seat next to me received her dinner but the flight attendant passed by me without leaving my dinner. She didn't even try to gently wake me up. When I woke up the flight attendant was two seats in front of me. I pressed the call button for someone to come see me and I also called out to the flight attendant, but she ignored me completely, unwilling to turn her head and look at me.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Sardi Tamas,4th September 2015,"I was flying Turkish Airlines from Istambul to Bodrum, a domestic flight within Turkey. Despite the fact I purchased business class tickets (not just for this route, but also to and from Turkey), when showing up at check in, they simply said they would downgrade me, because of overbooking. The way they handled the whole situation, kept us waiting for a long time both at check in, and also at boarding, the whole inconvenience was simply terrible experience. They offered a EUR50 check as compensation and thought this would be fair. After returning home, I wrote a complaint for the airline and their reaction is as scandalous as their operations: ""Concerning the matter you raised in your message, passengers not showing up for their flights cause flights to take place with empty seats. For this reason, as does every airline, Turkish Airlines, too, sells more tickets than the number of seats on the aircraft, from time to time. This situation is called overbooking, and in the case that all the passengers booked show up, some of our passengers unfortunately are unable to fly on the same flight."" Hence they think by explaining me as stupid kid, what overbooking means, they think downgrading is a fair action on their side and that was it. I am a frequent business traveller, this attitude and customer service is outrageous and luckily not everyday routine with other airlines. By the way, same thing happened to fellow travellers also on our way back Bodrum-Istambul-Budapest. Not just they downgraded them because of overbooking (seems to be pretty common with Turkish Airlines) but one of my friends ticket was also deleted from their system. Never heard of anything like this before. When she presented the printed version of her ticket (luckily she had it with her), Turkish Airlines said their system shows that because of overbooking, she was not only downgraded, but also transferred to another flight 1 day earlier than the actual flight. It also showed, that she actually took the flight the day before! This is madness.

A guy was waiting for us at the entrance and guide us to our gate which was very helpful and made us think that we will actually catch the flight.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Olesya Musorina,3rd September 2015,"We had a flight on Turkish Airlines from Moscow to Manila via Istanbul. Because our flight to Istanbul was delayed, we missed my second flight to Manila. After some time spent in queues we discovered the next flight to Manila will be two days after and staff of Turkish Airlines gave us the option to go to Manila next day via Bangkok. They told us that we should wait in the airport till they book our tickets. So, we waited for 3 hours without any service and during this time the staff couldn't do it. Only when we found manager he told us that we can go to hotel service and get our tickets tomorrow, and by that time it will be booked. It seems that staff from Turkish Airlines who told us we should wait our tickets didn't know about such option. Next day we got our boarding passes to Bangkok, and staff told us that we should get our tickets from Bangkok to Manila on Turkish Airlines transfer desk in Bangkok. They didn't tell us anything about second flight - no time, no airline. We asked about this flight from Bangkok to Manila two times - the guy on registration desk and the girl on supervisor desk. We also asked about our luggage and they told us that it will be sent to Manila with us. When we arrived to Bangkok, we didn't find any transfer desk of Turkish Airlines). It took a long time to found someone from Turkish Airlines with help of airport service, and at that time it turned out that flight, booked by Turkish Airlines for us, passed some time ago. After long investigation with girl from Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines they booked us tickets to Manila for the second time.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,T Gautam,1st September 2015,"The trouble started at SIN itself when our onward journey from IST to LIS was cancelled without notification. Upon inquiring at the airport, we were told that the cancellation was a mistake and that the sector would be reinstated. Once the reinstatement happened, we got our boarding passes. Looking at the trouble that we had, I asked the Turkish Airlines staff to reconfirm our return flight from IST to SIN and we were even allotted seats 16 A/B. The leg space in A330 is poor and I have never ever experienced such uncomfortable seats. The seating in Boeing 737 is more normal and I did not have any issues from IST to LIS.

Once we reached the counter we were informed that the flight is full. I told the agent that it is good for TK and I just want my boarding pass. I got the boarding pass after some reluctance on the agents part. I did not give it much importance but as soon as we moved from the counter, I saw STB on our seat allocation. I went back and inquired and was informed that we have been put on Standby. Even after informing the agent that I have confirmed seats, she said that she is unable to help me and that I would be helped at the gate. At the gate, the agents told us that a supervisor is going to come to help us out. However for the entire boarding time, no one came and only when we started to get agitated did someone come. There were approx 9 passengers who were on standby and the supervisor let 2 of them board. Then they allowed my wife to board and I was told that there is no more spare seat. I was angry and credit to the supervisor, he was professional and sent his assistant to physically check inside the aircraft and they found an empty seat which was allocated to me.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Ahmad Aweidah,27th August 2015,Planes were new and seats where like any European business class (i.e. economy seating with an empty middle seat) with the exception of the Istanbul - Amsterdam leg where it was a proper business cabin. Service was good and the food very good as usual. The lounge in Istanbul was great and I believe is truly exceptional by any airline standard. Turkish Airlines are also very competitive in price since their business class ticket was only a few dollars more than KLM or EL AL in economy. Transit in Istanbul was surprisingly smooth but i would recommend at least a 4 hour layover. It is obvious that the airline has outgrown it home base a long time ago and the airport can barely keep up with the volume of traffic going through. All four flights were delayed by at least 45 minutes to one hour which seems to be a standard now for TK flights.,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tel Aviv to Amsterdam via IST,August 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,yes,planes were new and seats where like any european business class ie economy seating with an empty middle seat with the exception of the istanbul - amsterdam leg where it was a proper business cabin service was good and the food very good as usual the lounge in istanbul was great and i believe is truly exceptional by any airline standard turkish airlines are also very competitive in price since their business class ticket was only a few dollars more than klm or el al in economy transit in istanbul was surprisingly smooth but i would recommend at least a hour layover it is obvious that the airline has outgrown it home base a long time ago and the airport can barely keep up with the volume of traffic going through all four flights were delayed by at least minutes to one hour which seems to be a standard now for tk flights

As mich as I've reviewed the good I'm also going to review the bad. Considering that they are competing with Etihad on this route it is very disappointing to see the aircraft quality. Business class seating was falling apart so badly that you could see the metal poles beneath it on some seats. Headrests too were so uncomfortable as well. The food and staff were fantastic on the flight and I can't fault this at all but the rest of it I don't have anything to complain about at all. The TK lounge in Istanbul is phenomenal as well. Flight departures on both sectors has actually been delayed in excess of an hour with everyone sitting onboard waiting in hot stuffy temperatures. At least on the IST-BEG flight there was an additional drink service but the poor people in Y didn't get this.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Paola Blanton,6th August 2015,"Turkish Airlines night flight from Heathrow through Ataturk on my way to Bulgaria. Arriving in Ataturk around 4 AM, I waited for the gate indication for the 7:30 flight to Bulgaria. Around 5:30am, it opened, so I went to the gate and showed the pair of Turkish Airlines employees my boarding pass and sat down right in the front row of the departure lounge. Exhaustion took over and I slumped in my chair, jerking awake to see the bus leaving for the plane and the big red letters CLOSED. I jumped to the desk and asked the man why he did not call me or wake me up, when he knew I was on that flight. He simply smirked and said â€œNot my responsibilityâ€. I asked him what I should do, but he was determined to brush me off, simply saying â€œtry going upstairs to the transfer desk.â€ Well, that set off a chain of absurdity the likes of which Iâ€™ve never seen in my life. It seemed that every employee, either of Ataturk Airport or of Turkish Airlines, ranged from nonchalant to downright belligerent. I was sent on a wild goose chase from desk to desk to desk, with practically everyone having the â€œnot my responsibilityâ€ attitude. There was no solution at the â€œtransfer deskâ€, and they kept sending me to other desks in what began to feel like some kind of absurd hazing ritual. Finally, after running the gauntlet several times, I was informed that I would have to clear immigration to get to the Turkish Airlines sales desk in the airport. Supposedly that was the only path to a solution for my problem. I stood in line for over an hour to get stamped, but was told â€œYou need a Turkish visa.â€ Incredulous, on my way to the visa desk, I asked the same information clerk why he didnâ€™t tell me that I needed a visa, and he (I am not making this up) told me â€œYou didnâ€™t ask. Itâ€™s not my responsibility to think for you.â€ At this point, I was choking back tears. I just couldnâ€™t believe it. I got back into line after paying 20 pounds for a visa and about an hour later finally got to the Turkish Airlines sales desk. The clerk informed me that it was â€œnot Turkish Airlinesâ€™ problemâ€ that I was not notified of the boarding and that I would have to pay an additional 265 euros in order to be able to board the next available flight, which was twelve hours later. I thought that was extremely unfair, given that I was at the gate on time and had identified myself to the ground staff. I thought I had the right to be informed of the flight leaving and woken up. Nothing I said to them was received with any amount of comprehension, compassion, or understanding. They said that if I didnâ€™t like their solution, I could go to their â€œsupervisorâ€™s deskâ€ at counter B15. At counter B15, I waited and waited until I finally got to talk to the extremely annoyed agent, who curtly informed me that she was â€œnot authorizedâ€ to handle my request, and that I was welcome to call customer service at the help phone.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,R Singletary,6th August 2015,"Both flights were okay and went smoothly, although I never thought my flight experience could be so greatly affected just by customer support! When we arrived in Istanbul (at almost midnight) we were informed that the airline would not be providing overnight accommodation (our next flight left about 13:40 the next day) because there was another flight coming from Rome in the morning - meaning it would have been possible for us to take that flight and not have as long of a layover. Not only did Turkish Airlines not tell us this until we arrived in Istanbul, they basically yelled this at us and then the agent walked away from the desk - worst customer service experience ever. Had we known this, I would have had no problem making hotel plans for that night prior to arriving of course but after experiencing this bad service we were then left to find a hotel for the night in a city we had never been to.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Ed Roggeveen,1st August 2015,"Two flights to get us from Ankara to Athens. The first leg was to Istanbul. Online check-in worked and very fast service at Ankara airport. Boarding started 50 minutes before flight due to go which seemed early. Flight was supposed to be 45 minutes, revised to 52, and eventually took 80 as we went past Istanbul and then turned back.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Robin Vazquez,1st August 2015,"We first went to Istanbul in a 4hr flight from Malaga. We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Gary Turner,23rd July 2015,I have flown with Turkish Air on previous occasions and found them very good. However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route. I would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business.,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to Ulaanbaator,July 2015,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,yes,i have flown with turkish air on previous occasions and found them very good however this experience was well below their usual good record firstly i have to comment on the turkish airlines business lounge at istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere but unfortunately its a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board then the seats in the boeing are the same as you would expect on a hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up and the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline this was an hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product we mysteriously had a hour stopover at some russian airport on the way that i was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there small as it was lastly out bags came out without any priority so i was really wondering why i paid times the economy ticket price i have previously been a strong supporter of turkish airlines but they let me down badly on this route i would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business
Turkish Airlines,1.0,Subrata Mohanty,17th July 2015,"I had travelled on 16th July from Munich to Dubai via Istanbul with my family. Our flight from Munich was delayed over an hour. Turkish Airlines staff didn't make much effort to hurry up the process. After landing at Istanbul, we ran across from one side of the airport to the other side in an effort to catch our connecting flight to Dubai. But by the time we reached the gate about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure the gate was closed and none of airline staff could be seen though they should have known that flights from Munich was delayed. There was absolutely no effort to accomodate the extra few minutes for delay in connecting flights. Next when we contacted Turkish Airlines staff about our next connecting flights, one staff member took our boarding passes for Dubai and disappeared for an hour leaving us at the desk. We tried to find out about our next flight status and other staff members were unwilling to answer us leaving us totally bewildered. Finally after waiting over an hour, our new boarding passes were issued. Finally when we landed at Dubai, our baggage were misplaced though we had specifically asked our baggage so to be transferred to new flight.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Jagoda Risteska,17th July 2015,"I am a wheelchair user and traveled alone this time. Turkish Airlines staff made a problem why I travel alone, remarking ""I am not supposed to travel alone"", ask me to sign a document which says they are not responsible for any damage or injury if I would enter the plane. No other passenger was asked to sign this document. Also, after disconnecting the joystick of my power wheelchair, they did not allowed me to take the joystick with me, but put it in a plastic bag and wanted to leave it like that in the cargo part. After I disagreed, because it can be easily damaged, Turkish Airlines staff said to me that the company would rather pay for the joystick than something to happen to the plane because of the joystick. The joystick itself, when disconnected from the batteries has no any power, our laptops and phones can make more problem than disconnected joystick. I have been traveling with Turkish Airlines for couple of times and what always happens is that I am informed as a wheelchair user that I am not able to use the toilet during the flight, because Turkish Airlines does not have cabin chair during the flight, nor they would assist to push the chair to the toilet (which is service other companies offer). The longest flight with Turkish Airlines, in which I was not able to use the toilet was flying from Istanbul to Cape Town, with two hours stop in Johannesburg, so for 15 hours I was not able to use toilet. For passengers without disability, Turkish Airlines may be a good choice, because of their good connections all around the world, but for me as a wheelchair user is a headache.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Karen Helweg-Larsen,6th July 2015,"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines â€“ starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips â€“ first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasnâ€™t a big surprise â€“ despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time â€“ on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul â€“ one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation â€“ and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members â€“ first to a supervisor in the check in area â€“ who said â€œnoâ€ and that was that. At the care Point â€“ the staff couldnâ€™t care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,W Rizvi,19th June 2015,"While the inflight service and comfort level of the seats were mediocre at best, my feedback deals with the service by the airline staff at the gate. My elderly parents were booked on a flight from Izmir to Houston via Istanbul and were to meet me in Istanbul for the Istanbul to Houston leg. The airline only gave 45 minutes between the Izmir flight and Istanbul-Houston flight. I assumed this meant that there would be no extra passport checks (since that was all done in Izmir) and that there would be gate attendants to direct the passengers trying to make the connection to the proper gate to expedite the process. That was not the case. The plane from Izmir was stood on the tarmac for 25 minutes so they had far less than 45 minutes to get to the Istanbul to Houston flight, which was already boarding at the time and there was no guidance at all. When I inquired as to whether the flight from Izmir had arrived at the Istanbul-Houston gate and when I explained the situation, the staff ignored me and told me to step out of the way. They told me my parents had 5 minutes to get there and that if they didn't the plane would leave without them. They also stated that there was nothing they would do. They would not announce their names and began to laugh at me and speak about me in Turkish in a mocking way. In short, not only were they were neither helpful nor sympathetic, but they were rude. Other passengers boarding the flight noticed this and expressed their displeasure, this was even echoed by some of the security staff of the airport. My parents finally made it. I wanted to like Turkish Airlines, however my trip made it quite plain that this airline is only a premiere airline for those in Business and First class.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,David Allen,4th June 2015,TK0033. Both flights from Houston to Istanbul were a delight. The seats were very comfortable and were nice on the new Boeing 777-300er and on the trip back on the Boeing 777-200er. Also the trip from Istanbul to Germany and back on the Airbus 321-200 were good. Entertainment system on the first but none on the way back to Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,K Thomsen,4th June 2015,LHR-SFO (return) via IST. Check-in at LHR was fast en efficient and the PrimeClass lounge was nice with a good food selection. Boarding at LHR was a bit chaotic but we got on board. First leg (LHR-IST) was a A321 with large seats in BC very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly. IFE was an older system with 4 movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable. IST airport is very overcrowded and even the BC lounge was packed so I decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel. A little pricey but well worth it. Boarding at IST was without any BC priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane. While airports like the old Doha airport had this down to an art IST seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all. Second leg was a B777 with a 2-3-2 configuration. I had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by I saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with 3 seats in the middle worked a charm. Flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike Gulf Airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at Turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it. Food was good and plentiful. The seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls. IFE offered true AVOD with a large selection of films and TV shows as well as live TV. Films were not all the latest and greatest but I think there was something for everyone. Return journey started out better than at LHR with quick and efficient check-in at SFO and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion. I had a quick look in the United Club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food. Plane was again a B777 with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews. Food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served. Short transit in IST where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no BC priority boarding and extra document checks. As a seasoned flyer I knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos. Not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish. Again a A321 this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the IFE was true AVOD (the same system as on the B777) and nice new seats. Again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served. The food was good but we got in to LHR about 20 minutes late because we were 30 minutes late out of IST. Price considered the offering is very good as long as you accept that IST airport is old over capacity and chaotic beyond belief.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,lhr-sfo return via ist check-in at lhr was fast en efficient and the primeclass lounge was nice with a good food selection boarding at lhr was a bit chaotic but we got on board first leg lhr-ist was a a with large seats in bc very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly ife was an older system with movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable ist airport is very overcrowded and even the bc lounge was packed so i decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel a little pricey but well worth it boarding at ist was without any bc priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane while airports like the old doha airport had this down to an art ist seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all second leg was a b with a -- configuration i had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by i saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with seats in the middle worked a charm flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike gulf airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it food was good and plentiful the seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls ife offered true avod with a large selection of films and tv shows as well as live tv films were not all the latest and greatest but i think there was something for everyone return journey started out better than at lhr with quick and efficient check-in at sfo and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion i had a quick look in the united club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food plane was again a b with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served short transit in ist where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no bc priority boarding and extra document checks as a seasoned flyer i knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish again a a this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the ife was true avod the same system as on the b and nice new seats again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served the food was good but we got in to lhr about minutes late because we were minutes late out of ist price considered the offering is very good as long as you accept that ist airport is old over capacity and chaotic beyond belief

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Samuel Sembiring,31st May 2015,Jakarta to Istanbul with a stopover at Singapore Changi. Check in was smooth even though Turkish didn't have a fixed check in counter in CGK. Boarding was fast and smooth. On CGK-SIN flight sandwich was served a good one with a selection of drinks. Then we have to leave the plane and reboard again one hour later at Changi. The SIN- IST leg was great the crew served properly but it lacked eye contact. They were chatting with fellow crew members while they were serving passengers. The catering service was good and the amenity case was a good looking tin pencil case which was a nice touch. The IFE was decent with a broad choice of movies and music. The return trip was in the same quality except a fair 45-60 minutes delay because of congestion at Istanbul Ataturk. My conclusion Turkish is a great choice for a long haul flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,jakarta to istanbul with a stopover at singapore changi check in was smooth even though turkish didnt have a fixed check in counter in cgk boarding was fast and smooth on cgk-sin flight sandwich was served a good one with a selection of drinks then we have to leave the plane and reboard again one hour later at changi the sin- ist leg was great the crew served properly but it lacked eye contact they were chatting with fellow crew members while they were serving passengers the catering service was good and the amenity case was a good looking tin pencil case which was a nice touch the ife was decent with a broad choice of movies and music the return trip was in the same quality except a fair - minutes delay because of congestion at istanbul ataturk my conclusion turkish is a great choice for a long haul flight

Food and drink better than average - I'll give them that. Istanbul airport is a crowded mess and the info monitors are not very informative. About 30 min before the scheduled boarding time they flash the message that our flight from Istanbul to Bologna was canceled along with > 40 other flights. No overhead announcement no airport workers in sight can explain coherently what to do or don't speak English. We later learn that a plane caught fire on landing and the runway was closed because of that.

We flew Qantas up to HK and had a 6 hour wait in HK. The first 3 hours of the flight is an eating delight. There were 2 fully decked out chefs on-board in Business class. The food presentation was just amazing. The food itself was very tasty and it just keep coming. Nothing was too much trouble. The table layout was like dining in a top restaurant and it even had an electronic candle that flickered. Breakfast was an equally excellent experience of service and taste. The seats are very roomy and quite comfortable for that long 11 hour flight and go fully flat. Ok the not so good. And it their lounge in HK. Its not their own lounge and its a shared arrangement. Its very down market and not very well appointed. To have a shower you had to book in and the next available time was 11.45pm 20 min after my flight was to leave.

My husband and I flew from Dusseldorf Germany to Istanbul. On our short (3-hour) flight we were served a full meal (they even hand out menu cards beforehand!). That alone impressed me but then when I saw how nicely it was arranged/presented and how good it tasted I was blown away. I don't think I've ever 'cleared my plate' on with any previous airline meal but that happened on both flights (to and from Istanbul). There was a pillow and headphones on each seat and the in-flight movie selection was incredible - my only complaint is that there were too many movies to choose from.

My overall experience was very positive: Turkish provides superb meals on transatlantic flights and even managed a satisfying mini-meal on the short Istanbul-Ankara flight. Cabin staff were abundant friendly and present on all four flights. Ticket counter and gate personnel had a somewhat severe affect but were nonetheless very helpful. Turkish B777's are fairly new (the oldest is less than 5 years old) clean and offer very good inflight entertainment. Lavatories seemed clean throughout the flight. Economy seating is quite cramped on Turkish B777's however but not to the point of discomfort.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Mondori Atsuko,26th April 2015,"TK 333 Baku to Istanbul. Six hours delayed without any explanation. Once it finally boarded and took off the crew never acknowledged the delay in any way just wished us a nice flight! Toward the end of the flight they announced gates for those who had not missed their connections. Never acknowledged that some of us had gave no instructions whatsoever. When I found a service desk the guy printed out my new boarding pass (for a flight the next morning) and threw it at me only when I asked did he blurt out something about going through passport control then to the hotel desk. By then it was late at night three PP control guys serving a huge crowd people starting to get angry and shout. I was afraid I would get through PP control then not get any help and be stuck outside the airport so instead I headed for the wonderful Turkish Airlines VIP lounge. There they refused to give me one of the sleeping rooms but did offer a ""five star hotel"" and a shuttle if I left the airport. By then it was so late that I would barely have time to get to the hotel before it would be time to return to the airport for my early flight so I hung out in the lounge all night. In all this time there was never the slightest apology for the delay or even a smile. I travel a great deal and am usually fine with different personal styles (and I love Turkey!) but this was over the top for lousy customer service.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,no,tk baku to istanbul six hours delayed without any explanation once it finally boarded and took off the crew never acknowledged the delay in any way just wished us a nice flight! toward the end of the flight they announced gates for those who had not missed their connections never acknowledged that some of us had gave no instructions whatsoever when i found a service desk the guy printed out my new boarding pass for a flight the next morning and threw it at me only when i asked did he blurt out something about going through passport control then to the hotel desk by then it was late at night three pp control guys serving a huge crowd people starting to get angry and shout i was afraid i would get through pp control then not get any help and be stuck outside the airport so instead i headed for the wonderful turkish airlines vip lounge there they refused to give me one of the sleeping rooms but did offer a five star hotel and a shuttle if i left the airport by then it was so late that i would barely have time to get to the hotel before it would be time to return to the airport for my early flight so i hung out in the lounge all night in all this time there was never the slightest apology for the delay or even a smile i travel a great deal and am usually fine with different personal styles and i love turkey! but this was over the top for lousy customer service

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Luis Starr,26th April 2015,Done 4 flight segments in 3 weeks DMM-IST IST-FCO BCN-IST and IST-DMM. Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Matthew Johnson,24th April 2015,"We flew LGW-IST-CMB on 16/4 and being a frequent flyer and Star Alliance Gold member I can easily say that this was the worst flying experience of my life. I have never met so rude uninterested and unhelpful staff on any other airline before. To start with I was denied access to a lounge at LGW. I am aware that Star Alliance do not have a lounge there but all other airlines I have used before have given me access to contracted lounges. TK did not. First flight as relatively OK on their new B737 but seats were very uncomfortable. Then we arrived in IST and the problems started. When I went to the lounge and connected my phone to the wifi I found an email from them saying ""your flight to {1} is delayed please contact {2}"". I went to the lounge reception and showed them the email and they told me it's nothing to worry about. When I looked on their website though I saw that the IST-CMB flight was delayed by 5 hours. From then it took us about 3 hours in order to sort out a hotel. When the flight departed the next morning there was no mention at all by anyone as to why the flight was delayed or a single apology. 10 hours on that plane and nothing. The crew were the most unprofessional and rude cabin crew. Not interested in passenger satisfaction and not interested in safety. Their English was very poor.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Edward Hill,19th April 2015,"Flew to London Heathrow from Hurghada via Istanbul. Everything started off fine. Punctual and a comfortable business class seat on what appeared to be a brand new 737-800. The problems then began with the plane landing in the ""wrong"" Istanbul airport. One very brief announcement from the Captain about weather and that is where the information stopped. No one on board was able to give us any information about missed connecting flights whilst we waited on the tarmac. Plane was full of connecting passengers. Plane then takes off to the correct airport. On arrival there was nobody from Turkish Airlines to process or inform customers of what to do. Eventually we found the transfer desk which had a minimum of 250 people descending on only 4 very harassed and extremely impolite ticket agents. When I finally got to the front the ticket desk agent simply stood up and walked away announcing that it was the end of his shift. Got a new pass for a plane leaving 5 hours later. Still no apology. Just thrown at me as if I should be grateful. Found the business class lounge that was also stuffed to the gunnels at the entry reception and barely a seat available in the place. Summoned to the new gate at far end of the airport. It was a full Airbus 330-300. There was a double security check leading to a seated area that was the size for a small commuter jet flight. 280 or so Passengers were rammed into each other waiting for the coach. There was no Business class fast track. On board staff were the most unfriendly bunch and seemed to have a collapse in their understanding of basic English. One seemed to really struggle with the concept of ""Could I have my lunch a bit later?"" Suffice to say my meal was served with no menu. I was then told that it was either Chicken or Pasta. They forgot to offer me the dessert and I had to chase them for it and was told ""We will see if we have anything left."" Even on disembarkation at the plane of the door they pointedly refused to say goodbye. The main hub is a complete mess and deeply unpleasant experience and the staff on board are feckless and rude. I would put this Business class experience down as the worst premium flight of my life. I fly on average 100 times per year nearly always in premium cabins. so that is saying something.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Bilkova Veronika,14th April 2015,PRG-IST and IST-PRG. My first flight with Turkish Airlines and quite a disappointment. We were about one hour late on both flights - as the air conditioning was not on it was awfully hot on the plane but no water was offered. The seats were not very comfortable and there was very little space. The flight attendants did not seem very interested in what people were doing (like playing with their mobiles and reclining the backs of their seats during the take-off). On the return flight there was a family with an infant squealing like an air raid siren sitting two rows away from me which turned the whole flight into a torture exercise. To finish on a positive note - food was very good and I appreciated having my own screen with flight information.

I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option. In addition the friendly and efficient staff the service standards catering in-flight entertainment and onboard comfort on Turkish Airlines (apart from seat pitch) were top notch.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,T Thompson,10th April 2015,From ORD-IST and back in economy. Row 16 and 22 respectively. Our first experience with Turkish. We requested vegetarian meals and a gluten free meal for my sister we all had excellent food and even had fresh squeezed orange juice (at least on the IST-ORD leg). The seats were comfortable too with a recline and a second option to slide the seat bottom outward giving more of a natural reclined feeling allowing better sleep without cramping the person behind you! Hot towels before the meal (I still love these simple things) and Turkish delight before service. The entertainment selection was good movies could have had a better selection but the music was fantastic. From the overall comfort and food quality I was able to sleep for 5 hours on a 9.5 hour night trip. I never sleep that much in economy! I believe their aircraft's sacrifice a few of the bathrooms for food/beverage/storage. It seems the bathrooms get used a bit more though there are never lines. The flight crew kept the bathrooms cleaned several times during the journeys. I would definitely fly them again mainly from the food and comfort perspective.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,J Konopak,30th March 2015,I fly Turkish to IST from several locations in Europe in economy. The airplanes tend to be a bit older and the crew tends to be pretty much the same as most airlines have in economy. Catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo can't speak about the inflight entertainment because I never use it. However there is one huge negative - the online checking is a mess giving PNR or e-ticket number works maybe 10% of the time and I'm forced to go to the airport early and queue to get a boarding pass even though I don't have any luggage. This is the only Star Alliance airline where this happens to me I've checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets. I've now started to avoid Turkish flights just for this reason as I need to waste about an hour in their huge and chaotic queues at Istanbul which also destroys any potential trip satisfaction.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,no,i fly turkish to ist from several locations in europe in economy the airplanes tend to be a bit older and the crew tends to be pretty much the same as most airlines have in economy catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo cant speak about the inflight entertainment because i never use it however there is one huge negative - the online checking is a mess giving pnr or e-ticket number works maybe of the time and im forced to go to the airport early and queue to get a boarding pass even though i dont have any luggage this is the only star alliance airline where this happens to me ive checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets ive now started to avoid turkish flights just for this reason as i need to waste about an hour in their huge and chaotic queues at istanbul which also destroys any potential trip satisfaction

Turkish Airlines,2.0,M LaPrairie,28th March 2015,TK8 IAD-IST. Seat 5K business class. Never again. I have been flying Qatar Airways a lot lately - no comparison. Late departure from IAD. Business cabin felt crowded with narrow aisles. Service rushed. Galleys were noisy with no attempt by the crew to be at all quiet. Seat not good with confusing controls (what does MR and M+ mean in the armrest controls?). Armrests and tray table were unmovable. So what if thereâ€™s a crew member wearing a chefs hat. The food was dreadful. Dried out. Overcooked. Tasteless. Terrible seats. Economy and business class passengers all mixed up with no clear delineation between the two cabins. The lavatories are so small that I banged my elbows in the most minimal effort to change clothes. Waste bins full before we'd even pushed back from Dulles and soap dispensers nearly empty. Unreal. Felt like Aeroflot in 1970. Appetizers dried out. I asked the flight attendant what kind of soup they were serving and she didn't know. So much for pre-departure briefings for the crew. Honestly a poor show for an airline that prides itself on its food. AVOD confusing and boring. Could never find the map. The crew spent most of its time standing at the â€˜barâ€™ looking at all of us like we were monkeys in a cage. Really unbelievable. The soccer stars who are advertising for TK are all flying on private aircraft - make no mistake. If they ever took TK they soon switch to Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific first class. FAs walking around with their airport IDs badges hanging from their necks - what is that all about? Really disappointed with TK. For all the hype in their advertising a big letdown.

I flew Turkish Airlines Business Class recently: Lisbon-Istanbul Istanbul-Seoul Bangkok-Istanbul and Istanbul-Lisbon and it was the least satisfactory business class in recent years.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Marc Guillemard,25th March 2015,"Flew from Paris to Samsum via Istambul and return in Economy. From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,P James,24th February 2015,BKK-IST-ARN on A330 and then A321. Flight from BKK late 1h arrived in IST in the midst of the snow chaos. Landed 2h late then stuck on tarmac for 1h. No gate so exit in severe snowfall and winds people in flip flops and t- shirts as this was from Thailand. Shipped on buses finally to terminal in utter chaos as all flights were cancelled. Thousands of people and only 3 TK representatives to help. Took into hotel at own cost rebooked tickets next morning via phone. Then headed for airport again flights cancelled again and no help anywhere and of course thousands of angry passengers stranded. TK head office is a place of shame that gave absolutely no help actually the sour lady just said no and then called for next in line. Result 2 days in IST from own pocket. Flying business and being star alliance gold gives little in this company when it matters. Even refused to be rebooked on other flights. Needless to say last flight IST-ARN was 1h late boarding commenced without communication between gate and crew so business passengers and others too stood 20 min outside of plane door watching crew clean the cabin and stock the food.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Xavier Bous,24th February 2015,The check-in and departure time are always chaotic with Turkish Airlines. I flew already 8 times with Turkish and they are usually late. Connections at Istanbul are tight which is not matching with the systematic delays of Turkish Airways. If you miss your plane the hotel is provided by Turkish Airlines but the transfer to the hotel is terrible without mentioning the terrible and unprofessional attitude from the visas service + immigration + info desks at Istanbul Airport. Globally I would not recommend Turkish Airways. Even if I omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is OK there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with Turkish Airways - maybe courtesy from their staff. The only point I am impressed about is that even if Istanbul Airport seems to be an organizational chaos the luggage is usually arriving at the final destination even when the time between connection flights are tight (of course if the planes are on time).,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,no,the check-in and departure time are always chaotic with turkish airlines i flew already times with turkish and they are usually late connections at istanbul are tight which is not matching with the systematic delays of turkish airways if you miss your plane the hotel is provided by turkish airlines but the transfer to the hotel is terrible without mentioning the terrible and unprofessional attitude from the visas service immigration info desks at istanbul airport globally i would not recommend turkish airways even if i omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is ok there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with turkish airways - maybe courtesy from their staff the only point i am impressed about is that even if istanbul airport seems to be an organizational chaos the luggage is usually arriving at the final destination even when the time between connection flights are tight of course if the planes are on time
Turkish Airlines,5.0,J Mann,24th February 2015,Flew TK 1332 BRE-IST then TK 716 IST-DEL round-trip. I booked the flight quite spontaneously and TK was surprisingly cheap. Having read that TK is quite good I was a little bit disappointed. Though the food was really great (the Turkish delight is delicious and I like the idea of the fresh orange juice) and I was even given a second menu the staff disappointed me. Perhaps it was only me but I didn't feel very welcome their English wasn't always understandable. Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun. Unfortunately there was no help offered by the FAs. All in all I chose not to recommend Turkish because the onboard product is just average and I prefer airlines being held by more democratic states than Turkey. Nevertheless the flight was quite cheap but in future I will try to avoid them.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,no,flew tk bre-ist then tk ist-del round-trip i booked the flight quite spontaneously and tk was surprisingly cheap having read that tk is quite good i was a little bit disappointed though the food was really great the turkish delight is delicious and i like the idea of the fresh orange juice and i was even given a second menu the staff disappointed me perhaps it was only me but i didnt feel very welcome their english wasnt always understandable furthermore my flight from bremen to istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting when the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun unfortunately there was no help offered by the fas all in all i chose not to recommend turkish because the onboard product is just average and i prefer airlines being held by more democratic states than turkey nevertheless the flight was quite cheap but in future i will try to avoid them

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Rajashekar Resmi,18th February 2015,I flew with Turkish Airways from Munich to Dubai via Istanbul. The tickets were cheap and the service was mediocre. The food was edible but not good. We reached Istanbul a little late and had to run to catch the connection flight. The staff was rude and was blaming us telling that they were about to close the gate and we should be more responsible. Cabin staff were also late to attend to our requests. I recommend the airline if the tickets are really cheap.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Sanjay Modak,18th February 2015,"Flew from DXB-IST-JFK in December 2014 and the return JFK-IST-DXB in January 2015. At check-in in DXB I requested an emergency exit seat for the IST-JFK leg. The rookie check-in agent first said nothing was available but his supervisor stopped by and found one for me. This made the long flight bearable. The flight was packed but the crew were cheerful and efficient and did everything right. Food was so-so - getting a bit weary of the standard kebabs and mystery veggies. The IFE was excellent - far better than Emirates' much touted IFE and better than QR. On the way back was checked in by a surly female agent at JFK. She couldn't find me an exit row on the A-330 to IST but said she found me a bulkhead one on the IST-DXB leg. The A330 was surprisingly comfortable much more so that the 777 even for my 6'3"" frame and the young lady next to me just curled up and slept the whole way through and was no bother to me. On the home leg I found that the seat the JFK agent had got me a seat in the row behind the bulkhead! On the 777 with the seats compressed for the 'short-haul' 4 hour flight to DXB I found sitting was unbearable. I silently cursed this agent and couldn't wait to deplane and get home. Service was once again good and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and tasty. But any satisfaction I got from this was neutralized by the uncomfortable seat and the incompetence of the check-in agent at JFK. This is the second time this has happened to me. A year ago flying from AGP-IST-DOH the agent at AGP assured me she had got me an exit row and I found myself directly behind exit row in a non-reclining seat. TK has to train its check-in staff to read the seat map better.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Tibor Palencsar,18th February 2015,Turkish Airlines deserves to be the #1 European airlines! It treats people in the economy class like other airlines treat business class passengers. The food and drinks we received was fantastic in-flight entertainment is also great (too bad it is available only on selected flights).

Turkish Airlines,2.0,L Byrne,12th February 2015,JFK-IST-DHA and return in Jan 15. Be advised that planes have no individual ventilation system and were unexpectedly quite warm on all segments. The planes on all segments were dirty. Leaving Istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked. There was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! There was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers. On US legs the staff were merely uninterested. On the Dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude. Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements. The lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited 3-4 hours outside the airport for a TA transfer to a hotel. Those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful TA rep to no avail. Never again. I will pay the extra for Emirates.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no,jfk-ist-dha and return in jan be advised that planes have no individual ventilation system and were unexpectedly quite warm on all segments the planes on all segments were dirty leaving istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked there was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! there was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers on us legs the staff were merely uninterested on the dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude though there was no noticeable turbulence on the dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for hours the lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call the fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water the attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass also delayed takeoff at dhaka which seems to be a hallmark of ta judging from these reviews caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night the only announcement in the cabin at landing at pm was to list the connecting gates but there were no flights until the next day there was no assistance with arrangements the lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited - hours outside the airport for a ta transfer to a hotel those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful ta rep to no avail never again i will pay the extra for emirates

Turkish Airlines,6.0,R Prabhu,30th January 2015,I flew ORD-IST-BOM and back. Checking in and Boarding at ORD was pleasant. The ORD-IST flight left on time and they offered Turkish Delight (sweet) on board with nice touches like hot towels for the face. Istanbul airport is the worst. The gate isn't announced until just 1 hour before departure and until then there is hardly any seating whatever there is it is for patrons of the overpriced restaurants. At the gate there was no boarding plan and no announcements! Just a hoard of passengers moving towards the gate in any random order. The most intriguing factor is their double standard- flights to/from the US serve Turkish Delights and hot towels have friendly staff who speak good English. On flights to India they don't serve any welcome sweet or hot towels and the staff are rude and can barely muster up basic English. On the return trip this double standard was confirmed. Also the flights to the US connect the airport with jetways where as Indian flights have to use a bus! Flights to the US require extra screening which again is done in a totally disorganized fashion and what's more our gate changed after the screening so we had to repeat the screening at the new gate! They ask weird questions going into much more detail than US immigration ever would and make you grossly uncomfortable.

This was the best long-haul flight I have taken. What impressed me on this flight was the cabin crew: they were smiling polite and always there. I felt sick (heavy headache) and two members regularly came to me (flight time was 13.30 hours due to bad weather conditions on the Atlantic) to check if I was feeling better or not.

Never did an airport representative bother telling us what was happening.

The food and service in the cabin was excellent but was let down by the physical cabin environment. Turkish Airlines should really think hard about assigning these aircraft on flights of 4 hours.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Mehdi Tahuri,21st January 2015,Travelled return trip from Montreal to Tehran with family. Had $600 deal which was great. Impressed with the number of hand outs. They hand out a bag full of slippers eye and ear covers toothbrush. They take care of kids very well too. Montreal to Istanbul flight was a newer plane. They are also not picky about a kilo or two overweight which is great. Per pay lounge in Istanbul is free for kids. For $21 you and your children can spend 6 hrs in an all you can eat snack lounge take a shower and recharge.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,A Goodwin,21st January 2015,We found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! A large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room. Only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them. There was inadequate space to pass resulting in feet being stood on and legs being banged every time someone needed to pass. When we arrived in Manchester staff had forgotten to request wheelchairs. In all made to feel like third class citizens. Don't accept disabled passengers if you don't want to look after them. There was very little help for us on this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,no,we found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! a large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them there was inadequate space to pass resulting in feet being stood on and legs being banged every time someone needed to pass when we arrived in manchester staff had forgotten to request wheelchairs in all made to feel like third class citizens dont accept disabled passengers if you dont want to look after them there was very little help for us on this airline

Turkish Airlines,5.0,S May,19th January 2015,Flew JFK-MAN in late December after reading recent reviews I was very hesitant about choosing Turkish. They were the cheapest legacy airlines on this route besides the slight detour to Turkey I thought no problem. Being star gold check in at JFK was easy with no waiting was informed at check in that flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of previous flight. I had a 2 hour connection in Istanbul asked the check in lady whether it'll be a problem she said no problem plenty of time. Went into Lufthansa lounge as it was the better option of lounges very good quality food/drinks and very quiet. Only problem was no monitors for boarding I proceeded to boarding gate at the time on the boarding pass and there was a was slight delay. Ended boarded first aircraft was clean and in good condition A330-300. Sat in the first section of economy in window finally departed 2hours late due to traffic at JFK knew I'd be pretty lucky to make my next flight. In-flight service was great food good quality and plenty of drinks frequently. Only part I could fault was the size of the offerings was on the small side besides that FA where attentive and helped passengers in every way. I found the onboard chef a bit of a laugh with his hat and outfit but it is a good look and it's a unique product in the industry. I asked one flight attendant what was to happen with my connection when I arrived - no help just said plenty of flights to MAN daily. Arrival into IST was when my next flight was boarding I thought I might have a slight chance if gates were close arrived to a remote stand and we were bussed in. No one was there to help connecting passengers everyone had no idea where to go I eventually found the transfer desk. Was put on a flight 5 hours later no food vouchers offered or compensation or an apology. I used the 'amazing lounge' which would be great with about 50% less people the lounge was packed it was struggle to find a table or chairs. I tired to get some sleep somewhere but was unable to. Asked to use shower but there was a 4 hour wait I said ok because I had five hours got given a buzzer and waited. Finally boarded MAN flight A320 it was uneventful good in-flight entertainment staff were good but less happy than previous leg. Turkish Airlines in-flight product is very good but they really need to work on ground staff and transfers at IST after that flight I said never again purely because of the transfer.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,no,flew jfk-man in late december after reading recent reviews i was very hesitant about choosing turkish they were the cheapest legacy airlines on this route besides the slight detour to turkey i thought no problem being star gold check in at jfk was easy with no waiting was informed at check in that flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of previous flight i had a hour connection in istanbul asked the check in lady whether itll be a problem she said no problem plenty of time went into lufthansa lounge as it was the better option of lounges very good quality fooddrinks and very quiet only problem was no monitors for boarding i proceeded to boarding gate at the time on the boarding pass and there was a was slight delay ended boarded first aircraft was clean and in good condition a- sat in the first section of economy in window finally departed hours late due to traffic at jfk knew id be pretty lucky to make my next flight in-flight service was great food good quality and plenty of drinks frequently only part i could fault was the size of the offerings was on the small side besides that fa where attentive and helped passengers in every way i found the onboard chef a bit of a laugh with his hat and outfit but it is a good look and its a unique product in the industry i asked one flight attendant what was to happen with my connection when i arrived - no help just said plenty of flights to man daily arrival into ist was when my next flight was boarding i thought i might have a slight chance if gates were close arrived to a remote stand and we were bussed in no one was there to help connecting passengers everyone had no idea where to go i eventually found the transfer desk was put on a flight hours later no food vouchers offered or compensation or an apology i used the amazing lounge which would be great with about less people the lounge was packed it was struggle to find a table or chairs i tired to get some sleep somewhere but was unable to asked to use shower but there was a hour wait i said ok because i had five hours got given a buzzer and waited finally boarded man flight a it was uneventful good in-flight entertainment staff were good but less happy than previous leg turkish airlines in-flight product is very good but they really need to work on ground staff and transfers at ist after that flight i said never again purely because of the transfer

Turkish Airlines,8.0,B Borg,14th January 2015,OSL-IST-MLA return. A widebody A330-200 aircraft operated OSL-IST sector. Excellent IFE (though no moving map channel or display). The dinner service was almost perfect. Very comfortable seat. Shame that eye contact by the cabin crew was almost inexistent and service delivered in a very robotic manner. Flight arrived at IST with a 1-hour delay. All in all a great flight. IST-MLA on a A320 aircraft in Y/C was very good especially the catering (freshly-squeezed orange juice and lemonade in economy together with turkish delight at the start of the service - very nice indeed). The crew on this flight was very friendly. In-seat audio IFE and moving map display in small overhead screens. Great flight. MLA-IST in Y/C on A320 aircraft. Good service and very good catering again. In-seat audio IFE not working (even though I tried 3 different seats. There was a moving map display in small overhead screens). The flight landed at IST almost 1hr 15 minutes late. Overall a very good flight. IST-OSL in Y/C on A330 widebody aircraft. Excellent IFE. Very good service friendly crew and good catering. A very good flight overall. I'll definitely consider flying TK again. TK must improve customer service culture among its staff (eye contact smiles and do away with robotic service).

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Tercon Bojan,14th January 2015,Pre - and post - flight experience was terrible! Delayed flight by several hours due to bad weather no one can give you information on your long-haul connecting flight that I missed and no business class service! Thankfully they make up for it onboard. Even though it's a narrow-body you have a chef onboard and the food is totally outstanding. You (nearly) forget about all the problems you've had until then! The 3.5 hour flight on an older A321-200 has a 3-3 business class configuration where the middle seat is made into a table. Comfortable.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Tercon Bojan,14th January 2015,I'm amazed that a 737-800 can fly 6 hours and 20 minutes which is how long this flight from Istanbul to Nairobi was. Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times. This is a great plane for continental flights but am not convinced it works for 6+ hour overnight flights.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,J Dand,11th January 2015,IST-BKK a flight we were looking forward to but which disappointed. Our domestic connection was very late but we were given no help at all at Ataturk to transfer to the international terminal in fact an airport staff member tried to prevent us taking the fast route through. The Bangkok flight was listed as only 10 minutes behind schedule so we did not get to the reportedly wonderful lounge but stood in line to board and waited and waited. Flight eventually took off nearly two hours late. Priority boarding OK and a very helpful ground staff who checked that our baggage had been safely transferred. Clean and comfortable Business cabin A330 300 with flat beds and 2x2x2 configuration. Full cabin tiny loos. We sat at the gate for more than an hour with no explanation or apology from the flight deck and took off just before 10pm. Cold drinks before take off champagne after take off dry tepid towel offered. The meal was good but not fantastic and each course took so long to come. Not to use trolleys in a full cabin may look good but slows things down so much. No proper wine glasses we were given our second requested glass of champagne in a large water tumbler! This lack of style and training was obvious at all times. FAs were friendly and obliging but not confident or capable as on many other premium airlines. One had so little English she could not understand us or we her. Good choice of entertainment but the amenities bag was awful. Posh bag very little inside no face cream and the slippers had been used and recycled. Poor storage and FAs had no idea what to do with pillows and duvets once passenger luggage was in the racks. Completed breakfast orders were not collected but we handed ours over. The hot part of breakfast was worse than any premium cabin we've flown in: flabby white toast inedible unseasoned eggs. No announcement from the flight deck about our lateness of arrival or apology/explanation of why. No local time check either and when we asked a FA he got it wrong by an hour!

Food on the flight was abundant and of a very good quality. Staff were attentive and helpful throughout the whole flight. Inflight entertainment was varied with pretty good choices. Seat was ok but after a 14 hour flight everything seems a little uncomfortable I guess. The only negative was perhaps the craziness encountered at Istanbul Ataturk airport and the uncaring attitude of people at the airport.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Graham Ian,31st December 2014,After my outward bound flight from Amsterdam to Kathmandu (TK1952 and TK726) I was ready to write a rampage of discontent if the return flight was anything as bad. For almost a month from mid-November the Istanbul-Kathmandu sector had never been less than four hours late except for two or three days when it left Istanbul two hours early! On the day we travelled there was a six hour delay meaning we had to wait at Istanbul airport for 10 hours. No excuse or apology was offered. When we eventually boarded they had changed the aircraft from the day before when we had booked our seats online so we found ourselves sitting in seats next to the toilets and with no recline. There was also no IFE. Clearly the aircraft was from another era. An hour after we eventually took off (0200) and when I was finally nodding off to sleep I was rudely awoken by one of the crew and offered breakfast - at 0300! I was also offered wine with breakfast! So it was with some trepidation that I awaited my return journey fully expecting a long delay and wait at Kathmandu Airport which is no pleasure! Fortunately from two days before my departure the flight was running on time. What a different experience. A new(er) plane that had IFE an excellent service from the cabin crew on both flights. Why travellers to Kathmandu were singled out for such delays when nearly all long haul flights are on time remains a mystery. Because of the risk of it happening again I would not fly Turkish Airlines to this destination but otherwise I find them more than acceptable.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,after my outward bound flight from amsterdam to kathmandu tk and tk i was ready to write a rampage of discontent if the return flight was anything as bad for almost a month from mid-november the istanbul-kathmandu sector had never been less than four hours late except for two or three days when it left istanbul two hours early! on the day we travelled there was a six hour delay meaning we had to wait at istanbul airport for hours no excuse or apology was offered when we eventually boarded they had changed the aircraft from the day before when we had booked our seats online so we found ourselves sitting in seats next to the toilets and with no recline there was also no ife clearly the aircraft was from another era an hour after we eventually took off and when i was finally nodding off to sleep i was rudely awoken by one of the crew and offered breakfast - at ! i was also offered wine with breakfast! so it was with some trepidation that i awaited my return journey fully expecting a long delay and wait at kathmandu airport which is no pleasure! fortunately from two days before my departure the flight was running on time what a different experience a newer plane that had ife an excellent service from the cabin crew on both flights why travellers to kathmandu were singled out for such delays when nearly all long haul flights are on time remains a mystery because of the risk of it happening again i would not fly turkish airlines to this destination but otherwise i find them more than acceptable

Turkish Airlines,1.0,G Harris,10th December 2014,Turkish Airlines staff are normally brusque and indifferent but when one of their flights is delayed they really excel themselves in terms of inscrutable disdain. Firstly TK0805 to Istanbul (5/11/14) the cabin crew didn't seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not. When we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting Turkish flight to London. So not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said 'yes it'll be held'. Everyone rushed to the gate. Low and behold it wasn't held. Sent from pillar to post to interact with various other stony-faced employees who frankly don't care. Not a single person ventured an apology.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no,turkish airlines staff are normally brusque and indifferent but when one of their flights is delayed they really excel themselves in terms of inscrutable disdain firstly tk to istanbul the cabin crew didnt seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not when we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting turkish flight to london so not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said yes itll be held everyone rushed to the gate low and behold it wasnt held sent from pillar to post to interact with various other stony-faced employees who frankly dont care not a single person ventured an apology

Turkish Airlines,1.0,I Thernot,4th December 2014,TK60 from IST to KUL in economy. Food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely 4-star standard. However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response. I recommend taking rubber boots on your next TK flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,no,tk from ist to kul in economy food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely -star standard however the crew had a new trick which i have not seen before one of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use it was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea to add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response i recommend taking rubber boots on your next tk flight

Meal I had was good and I relaxed for the rest of the flight. On descent they announced that they would come round for newspapers cups etc but they did not. During the taxi to the gate people started getting up all over the aircraft even though there had been an announcement not to do so but none of the crew attempted to stop them. Luggage was already on the carousel when we arrived.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Kovak John,1st December 2014,I flew business Dublin to Bangkok via Istanbul. First leg of the trip was ok on par with premium economy but no business class. The leg from Istanbul to Bangkok was the worst flight I have had. We arrived late into Istanbul from Dublin and were running late to catch the connecting flight aircrew told us that ground staff were waiting to escort us once we had disembarked well once we had been dumped by the bus at the terminal gate there was no staff to help just the usual mess in Istanbul. We eventually found our gate which lucky for us was running late. So as business class we had priority boarding but in reality this was only onto to the bus which then with everyone else on the flight dumped us in the pouring rain at the rear of the aircraft and we had had to fight our way through to our seats at the front. We took our seats and after some time were offered some water or juice â€“ same as economy. There were 5 airline staff looking after a full business class plus the 2 chefs. The service offered did not reflect. About half an hour after take off face wipes were offered however mine was cold and smelt -â€“not offered a replacement. We were offered a drink I chose champagne which when arrived hardly wet the glass with the quantity given and was warm. A short time later the meal was served which was ok and edible. I managed to get 2 glasses of wine from the crew during the meal. Crew were in a hurry to get your trays packed away and 2.5 hours into the flight all alcohol was locked away and never seen again. Crew took themselves of to hide behind their curtains and not to be seen until 2 hours before we landed when a miserable breakfast was served which I had not ordered. There was 1 business class toilet to service the crew and passengers and the crew seemed to have it in use 80% of the time in the last hour when most passengers were also trying to use it. There were no amenities in the toilet hard paper towels no small cups sink was filthy floor wet. Finally after disembarking in Bangkok getting through customs etc quickly through to the baggage carousel I expected that our bags would be out quickly as we had priority baggage no they came out last and after just about every one else had left the Airport. I have flown Turkish economy before and have found them to be very good and thought that business class would be good but it was awful.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,no,i flew business dublin to bangkok via istanbul first leg of the trip was ok on par with premium economy but no business class the leg from istanbul to bangkok was the worst flight i have had we arrived late into istanbul from dublin and were running late to catch the connecting flight aircrew told us that ground staff were waiting to escort us once we had disembarked well once we had been dumped by the bus at the terminal gate there was no staff to help just the usual mess in istanbul we eventually found our gate which lucky for us was running late so as business class we had priority boarding but in reality this was only onto to the bus which then with everyone else on the flight dumped us in the pouring rain at the rear of the aircraft and we had had to fight our way through to our seats at the front we took our seats and after some time were offered some water or juice same as economy there were airline staff looking after a full business class plus the chefs the service offered did not reflect about half an hour after take off face wipes were offered however mine was cold and smelt -not offered a replacement we were offered a drink i chose champagne which when arrived hardly wet the glass with the quantity given and was warm a short time later the meal was served which was ok and edible i managed to get glasses of wine from the crew during the meal crew were in a hurry to get your trays packed away and hours into the flight all alcohol was locked away and never seen again crew took themselves of to hide behind their curtains and not to be seen until hours before we landed when a miserable breakfast was served which i had not ordered there was business class toilet to service the crew and passengers and the crew seemed to have it in use of the time in the last hour when most passengers were also trying to use it there were no amenities in the toilet hard paper towels no small cups sink was filthy floor wet finally after disembarking in bangkok getting through customs etc quickly through to the baggage carousel i expected that our bags would be out quickly as we had priority baggage no they came out last and after just about every one else had left the airport i have flown turkish economy before and have found them to be very good and thought that business class would be good but it was awful

Can't say enough good about the flights as everything from check in to landing went on-time smooth with excellent service both on the ground and in-flight. Considering that I saved over $1000 per person on this routing compared to BA LH and any of the domestic carriers - their in-flight service was far superior to the other transatlantic carriers I've flown over the past 25+ years. Would compare their service to Cathay Pacific. The meal service was outstanding. I've never had meals of this quality before on any airline in First or Business Class. You have to experience it to believe it. Great value for the price I paid and the wonderful service received.

Of the 22 members of the group who arrived from all corners of the world nearly everyone had a story about Turkish failings. Business class on TK46 from IST to KIX was a perfect example. Plane was a beat up 330-200. Boarding was a mess. Loaded onto a bus in IST in the rain. Driven around the tarmac for 15 minutes to our plane. All passengers loaded through the rear of the plane on a mobile jetway in the rain. To get to the business cabin we had to 'swim upstream' to our seats. After settling in to 4a and 4b (in the beat up cabin) discovered that the toilets (tried to find a clean one of the 4) had not been cleaned. The cabin crew could not be bothered.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,R Dee,31st October 2014,I had a short 2-hr flight from Naples to Istanbul before transferring to JFK-NY. It was a full flight and they were far over their overhead storage capacity by about 8 carry-on suitcases. Often you'll be a few spaces short but I've seldom seen that many. I imagine the problem was caused because the airline check-in agent was not enforcing the 1 carry-on 1 personal item (which is to be pushed under seat or held on your lap) policy. This is negligence on the airlines part. However the flight attendants did the right thing by keeping on the carry-on luggage onboard and not putting it beneath the plane therefore allowing us to be on our way quickly. They offered excellent service with full meal alcoholic beverages and newspapers offered free on a 2-hr flight. The service on the flight from Istanbul to JFK was also quite good. However for whatever reason they did not allow you to pick your seat when you book (at least the system didn't when I tried) so as I result I got stuck in a middle seat which I always try to avoid.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,i had a short -hr flight from naples to istanbul before transferring to jfk-ny it was a full flight and they were far over their overhead storage capacity by about carry-on suitcases often youll be a few spaces short but ive seldom seen that many i imagine the problem was caused because the airline check-in agent was not enforcing the carry-on personal item which is to be pushed under seat or held on your lap policy this is negligence on the airlines part however the flight attendants did the right thing by keeping on the carry-on luggage onboard and not putting it beneath the plane therefore allowing us to be on our way quickly they offered excellent service with full meal alcoholic beverages and newspapers offered free on a -hr flight the service on the flight from istanbul to jfk was also quite good however for whatever reason they did not allow you to pick your seat when you book at least the system didnt when i tried so as i result i got stuck in a middle seat which i always try to avoid

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Nick Kambounias,28th October 2014,My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Nick Kambounias,28th October 2014,My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,T Bailey,28th October 2014,Rome to Istanbul. The original flight was initially delayed but we were given little information. Eventually we were told another aircraft would be coming from Istanbul and we would be given a meal. There were so many restrictions and inconsistencies with the meal provided. Information on the flight was not available despite several requests. Inaccurate information was given regarding the need to change boarding passes. The ground staff were next to useless and when the supervisor eventually arrived he was boarding of downright aggressive and would not rectify our problem with boarding passes. The flight was underwhelming. Inflight entertainment system was not working and my requested special meal was not available. On landing passengers were walking around the aircraft as it was moving. The cabin crew did nothing and even laughed at the child running up and down the aisle as the aircraft was moving.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,rome to istanbul the original flight was initially delayed but we were given little information eventually we were told another aircraft would be coming from istanbul and we would be given a meal there were so many restrictions and inconsistencies with the meal provided information on the flight was not available despite several requests inaccurate information was given regarding the need to change boarding passes the ground staff were next to useless and when the supervisor eventually arrived he was boarding of downright aggressive and would not rectify our problem with boarding passes the flight was underwhelming inflight entertainment system was not working and my requested special meal was not available on landing passengers were walking around the aircraft as it was moving the cabin crew did nothing and even laughed at the child running up and down the aisle as the aircraft was moving
Turkish Airlines,5.0,E Simeone,15th October 2014,BRU-IST-BRU c class - rather smooth check in BRU. Used fast track and lounge. TK uses SN lounge in Brussels which is always too crowded understaffed and unclean with little food choices. Especially if you bear in mind 2 UA flights 1 AC and one Hainan plus all of El Al and Turkish and all of SN and other Star Alliance flights all sharing this non Schengen lounge at the same time! Too vile and disgusting. No Senator members lounge at all! Even Vienna has got one. Boarding was the usual TK mess but must say flight ok A320 excellent configuration and experienced staff. Expecting an A330 as earlier planned but change of plane (must say not enough pax). Arrival in IST using fast track arrivals plus optional lounge in IST a breeze. Return again smooth check in Istanbul plus fast track plus lounge a breeze and absolutely exquisite for a business class lounge!

Although I had some reservations flying with Turkish at the end I was more than happy that I chose them. The meal service was excellent. Best meal I ever had on a transatlantic flight. The A330-300 was comfortable and the flight entertainment had great variety of movies and games to choose from. I reserved our seats 3 months in advance by calling the call center.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Alimul H Chowdhury,13th October 2014,I made 2 trips to Dhaka last year and both ways missed the connecting flight in Istanbul.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Ali Soufan,8th October 2014,BEY-LHR via Istanbul. Flight was delayed by 45 mins to depart from Beirut. Flight was packed from Beirut to Istanbul operated by an old A321 with no personal TV. To be honest one of the things that was brought to my attention the carelessness of the cabin crew in checking seat belts and providing the appropriate safety demonstrations no announcement was made from the captain at all during the whole flight. Nevertheless once we got to Istanbul I nearly made my connecting flight to LHR. Again flight was operated by an A321 with no ptv which I found very surprising. Again service was not great however they served good food. Overall would not fly again with them due to their very tired aircraft's being used on the route and due to the service of both the cabin crew and the hassle for connecting passengers in Istanbul.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,no,bey-lhr via istanbul flight was delayed by mins to depart from beirut flight was packed from beirut to istanbul operated by an old a with no personal tv to be honest one of the things that was brought to my attention the carelessness of the cabin crew in checking seat belts and providing the appropriate safety demonstrations no announcement was made from the captain at all during the whole flight nevertheless once we got to istanbul i nearly made my connecting flight to lhr again flight was operated by an a with no ptv which i found very surprising again service was not great however they served good food overall would not fly again with them due to their very tired aircrafts being used on the route and due to the service of both the cabin crew and the hassle for connecting passengers in istanbul
Turkish Airlines,3.0,P Bischoff,5th October 2014,IST-VCE-IST - Boarded pretty much on time but departed Istanbul 1 hour late with the aircraft sitting on the tarmac with Ataturk airport almost always congested that's nothing new. Cabin very hot and stuffy until the end of the flight. Of course no beverage service until 40 minutes into the flight. 737-900ER which looked brand new cabin very clean nice looking seats but with typical THY pitch so not much space to move. Reclining button missing/broken so impossible to move the backrest. Nice choice of movies on the IFE and big screen when the thing worked the whole system rebooted on all seats after a while and my lucky colleague next to me has his rebooted a dozen times or more until the flight attendant attempted to fix it by rebooting it a few more times and then gave up. Service as usual with THY OK if you don't expect too much the only friendly and smiling stewardess was the one who did not speak any English. Return flight on A321-200 departed on time from VCE and full almost to the last seat. Good for them. Slow food service with only 2 stewards each with one trolley and that took ages mine ran out of beef kebab after the 10th row. The 2 of us had beef served cold and mine was some kÃ¶fte dish which was not even on the menu. I guess it was some leftover from a previous flight and re-heated twice the lid was already open and it was stone cold. My colleague had the time to finish watching his movie from the previous flight and arrival was on time in IST. Every time I am stuck with flying Turkish I wonder how they manage to get Europe's best airline award and now for the 3rd year.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,F Bertoni,5th October 2014,Another fantastic journey with Turkish Airlines. Sao Paulo-Istanbul: flew Comfort class which in my opinion is excellent value for money. Seats were only 50% taken in this class and I could thus enjoy three seats free for me. The space and comfort of this class is comparable to Business class of many other airlines. The seat is wide the space for legs is exceptional the IFE was also nice with noise cancelling earphones distributed. Service: top notch. Food was of very good quality in abundance and served with almost Business class layout (real plates and real towels) both for breakfast and the dinner served two hours before landing in Istanbul. Cabin crew was discreet but always present when needed: I asked twice for some juice and had the glass delivered at my seat within a couple of minutes. Did land in IST after 12 hours and 45 minutes with a delay of 2 minutes.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,J Stein,24th September 2014,"I read some variable reviews before booking my flights from NJ to Istanbul so decided against direct flight and booked United to Munich then TA to Istanbul then TA back to Frankfurt and Lufthansa back to NJ. TA was by far the best parts of the trip with over-the-top service plenty of stretch room in business class (I'm 6'1"") and solid quality food. I liked the repeated options to grab another croissant / roll or requests whether I wanted a refill of wine or coffee. The Airbus A330s I flew were new and immaculate. My only complaint was the boarding process which wasn't well organized in Munich at all with a long narrow gate where everyone across all classes congregated and blocked any chance for an organized boarding. Had I not been near the front I would have been one of the last to board despite my business class seat and never heard a call for that class to board. The return trip was a bit better with the gate agent asking out loud - not over the PA - whether anyone was in business class and directed us to a separate line that was initially hidden from view.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,B Fowler,17th September 2014,"My husband and I took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between London and Antalya via Istanbul. We chose Turkish Airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than Easyjet etc. Check in at LHR was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient. The flight was delayed. In fact all four flights were delayed. We were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight (my husband is 6'6"") but were able to move once the flight was underway. As we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it. When I asked why (no explanation was volunteered) I was told the plane had changed. On boarding I was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband. Needless to say I moved once the flight was underway. No apologies from staff. On arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases. After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful.

Very nice and efficient cabin crew. Long transfer at IST Ataturk Airport. For such a reason Turkish paid a very nice hotel for me (5 stars) located in the city center. Free transfers also provided both ways. Istanbul-Sao Paulo: 13 hours daily flight aboard a new 773-full flight. I got the emergency exit which means a lot of space for a better rest. The 3-3-3 seat configuration in Economy is extremely appreciated and TK is one of the few airlines world-wide which still keeps it nowadays. Very young and pleasant cabin crew.

After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful. Seatbelt signs kept on for most of flight and flight attendants almost invisible for the rest of the journey.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no,my husband and i took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between london and antalya via istanbul we chose turkish airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than easyjet etc check in at lhr was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient the flight was delayed in fact all four flights were delayed we were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight my husband is but were able to move once the flight was underway as we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it when i asked why no explanation was volunteered i was told the plane had changed on boarding i was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband needless to say i moved once the flight was underway no apologies from staff on arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases after waiting for a long time late in the evening someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal no apologies no directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone on arrival at antalya airport weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic asked for legroom seats - were given them for the first flight but not the second no explanation or apology legroom was non existent - even i struggled to fit my husband found it impossible we asked if it was possible to move and were told no - no explanations or apologies again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyones way the person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so my husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit no care understanding or apologies i pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat his knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins food dreadful seatbelt signs kept on for most of flight and flight attendants almost invisible for the rest of the journey
Turkish Airlines,10.0,S Neuhauser,12th September 2014,"Travelled VIE-IST-JFK-IST-Vie at the end of July. We booked Premium Economy with TK to N.Y. for a family trip as TK offers best value in this class (only slightly more expensive than the cramped Y-class on any direct flight from Vienna to N.Y. in peak season unfortunately there is no Premium-Y ex Vienna). 3 days befor departure we received note from TK that due to an aircraft switch ""Comfort Class"" (only on TK's 777) would not be available on the 10-hour flight from IST to JFK thus we were offered a later flight. I requested an update to C-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from TK and just what I expected from ""Europe's best airline""! Our 2-hour morning flight to IST in Y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served (fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering). Our connecting flight was in C-class so we enjoyed the marvellous TK lounge at IST airport that streches over 5000 square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed Turkish Coffee! The flight to JFK on an Airbus A-330 in business class was as comfortable as it can get (welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds Do&Co flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling FAs a wide range of movies). Bottomline: we arrived relaxed and happy. Only a minor point: cabin design could be slightly more colourful. Unfortunately our flight back to Vienna via IST was not upgraded so we travelled in ""Comfort Class"" as planned. Seats are in CC are wide and legroom is plenty. There were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind C-Class (keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight!) but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying. The amenity bag distributed in ""Comfort Class"" wasn't Porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy. At IST we spent some time at the ""Prime Class Lounge"" (we pre-booked this service before we departed) where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight. The final leg of our journey took us back to Vienna in Y-class in the late afternoon. Again menu cards with an extra drink/wine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by TK considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on 2 hour flights. Final verdict: I wholeheartedly recommend Turkish!",,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,travelled vie-ist-jfk-ist-vie at the end of july we booked premium economy with tk to ny for a family trip as tk offers best value in this class only slightly more expensive than the cramped y-class on any direct flight from vienna to ny in peak season unfortunately there is no premium-y ex vienna days befor departure we received note from tk that due to an aircraft switch comfort class only on tks would not be available on the -hour flight from ist to jfk thus we were offered a later flight i requested an update to c-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from tk and just what i expected from europes best airline! our -hour morning flight to ist in y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering our connecting flight was in c-class so we enjoyed the marvellous tk lounge at ist airport that streches over square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed turkish coffee! the flight to jfk on an airbus a- in business class was as comfortable as it can get welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds doco flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling fas a wide range of movies bottomline we arrived relaxed and happy only a minor point cabin design could be slightly more colourful unfortunately our flight back to vienna via ist was not upgraded so we travelled in comfort class as planned seats are in cc are wide and legroom is plenty there were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind c-class keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight! but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying the amenity bag distributed in comfort class wasnt porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy at ist we spent some time at the prime class lounge we pre-booked this service before we departed where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight the final leg of our journey took us back to vienna in y-class in the late afternoon again menu cards with an extra drinkwine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by tk considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on hour flights final verdict i wholeheartedly recommend turkish!
Turkish Airlines,6.0,L Newton,10th September 2014,Flew business class with my wife from BHX to IST. Comfortable enough on both legs but late departures on each flight. Cabin crew were good to excellent though service rather grudging and not as attentive as my experiences with Emirates. Aircraft cabin littered on both legs.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,M Basi,10th September 2014,Booked Business Class BHX to DEL via IST. Business Class Service on the BHX to IST very hit and miss. Steward seemed nervous took my order for drink and forgot to bring me the drink. Later on during the flight the FA took my order for a drink and this one came. Flight attendant serving drinks without bringing them on a serving tray certainly shows me that the Turkish Airways staff need training and overall the service in business class was poor. The lounge at Istanbul is very good. Istanbul to Delhi boarding a shambles. No segregation between Business Class and Economy on boarding especially if you have to travel to the plane by bus. IST TO DEL - one of the most uncomfortable business class seats in the air. I travelled on 22/8/2014. I am going to travel in Business Class on the same route BHX to DEL VIA IST on October and I am hoping for better service.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,N Nanayakkara,10th September 2014,Traveling from St Petersburg to Istanbul in business class - very disappointed the business class on this ageing 757-800 was no better than economy class. The seats were economy did not recline more than 15 degrees. The centre seat of an economy row was made inactive by folding it down. Hence calling the two seat arrangement business class. Extra leg room was there but was of no use as the footrest was fixed. How can they be called the best airline in Europe when they do not provide the basic requirement for a business class seat.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,s Neda,6th September 2014,Traveling from Boston on August 22 the flight was scheduled for 11.45 we waited several hours without knowing what was going on until. At 3 am they told us the flight was cancelled and we had to recollect our baggage. They sent passengers to different hotels some as far as state of New Hampshire. Crammed us to the bus while some passengers did not have a seat and there was not enough luggage space. On August 23 they told us the flight will leave at 6 pm. After we got back to the terminal at 3 oâ€™clock the flight was delayed again with no clear reason given. We were waiting not knowing if we are actually going to fly. While complaining to them they would respond that there was going to be somebody at Istanbul airport waiting for us to take care of all complaints but when we arrived in Istanbul we could not find anybody. When calling the airline regarding the issue the representatives would sayâ€œour system shows that there was no flight cancellation on August 22â€and we had to convince them that the flight was actually cancelled and there were hundreds of people on that flight and some missed the collecting flights and hotel reservations. On my way back to Boston although I purchased my ticket 5 months earlier they changed my status to Standby without notifying me and I had to wait until all the passengers get on board and hope for open seat.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,G Penola,6th September 2014,TK66M IST-SIN on 31/8/14 - The THY lounge at Istanbul Airport whilst impressive was very busy and noisy. It is not a place to relax. Already the lounge is starting to show signs of wear and tear despite opening only recently. The entry gates were mostly broken and barricaded off. On this visit the hot food had all but disappeared which was disappointing prior to taking a 1am flight to Singapore. Flight was OK cabin crew not very interested in passengers and disappeared for most of the flight. The flat beds on this aircraft seemed quite hard and was difficult to get comfortable and to sleep. The English spoken by the captain and flight attendants was below average for an international airline.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Faiz Eljunaid,6th September 2014,"We are a family of four. I travelled with Turkish Airlines Doha-Istanbul-Doha and booked seats online on row 6 on both flights. On check-in for the return flight TK-0782 on Sept. 2nd I was given seats on row 21! I talked to the check-in supervisor and she told me that the plane had been changed and the seat numbers are rearranged by the system and she can not do any thing about this. On boarding I was surprised to find that row 21 is a 4-seats row beside the exit with smaller tight and uncomfortable seats. There were some other passengers complaining about their seating as well. I talked to the flight dependant in-charge and he responded in an impolite way and giving instructions to return to our seats. I told him that I will report this online.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Rob Garbett,1st September 2014,IST-BHX. I have flown on Turkish Airlines about 60 times over the last 18 months. I have noticed a general decline in the quality of service. This was very marked on my last flight from Istanbul to Birmingham. The seat I has was almost worn out and very uncomfortable. The cabin service was poor. They offer a choice of meals but do carry enough of the options to provide choice to all. On this occasion they had given all the meals out of my preferred option after only 4 or 5 rows of passengers. They did not offer any option.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,M Palmer,28th August 2014,TK 2421 Antalya to Istanbul August 11. TK 66 Istanbul to Jakarta August 12. We have always enjoyed TK and have flown it many places around the world each time in Business Class. There does seem to be a difference in both the service and attitude on the 330 vs 777 airplanes. The 777 FA's are more caring and do not disappear after service. After numerous long haul flights is seems that the FA's on the 330 are less trained and really do not care. Yesterday on the Istanbul to Singapore flight a FA attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage. It was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding. Another thing is the food. When a flight leaves Istanbul at 1 am on a 10 hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner. We have yet to have an edible breakfast even in Business Class. The eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery Turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber. You would think that with nobody eating the entrÃ©e that they would stop serving it. The funny thing is that the meals served in the European Business Class are quite good. The Business Class lounge in Istanbul remains the best in the world. We love spending time there. Unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in Istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly. The taxi ways and concourses are a disaster. You would think there would be separate lines for Business and Economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no. We will continue to fly Turkish Airlines because we feel safe and the price is right. Occasionally we get a good flight crew. But it is all hit and miss. The one consistent thing about Turkish Airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,yes,tk antalya to istanbul august tk istanbul to jakarta august we have always enjoyed tk and have flown it many places around the world each time in business class there does seem to be a difference in both the service and attitude on the vs airplanes the fas are more caring and do not disappear after service after numerous long haul flights is seems that the fas on the are less trained and really do not care yesterday on the istanbul to singapore flight a fa attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage it was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding another thing is the food when a flight leaves istanbul at am on a hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner we have yet to have an edible breakfast even in business class the eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber you would think that with nobody eating the entre that they would stop serving it the funny thing is that the meals served in the european business class are quite good the business class lounge in istanbul remains the best in the world we love spending time there unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly the taxi ways and concourses are a disaster you would think there would be separate lines for business and economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no we will continue to fly turkish airlines because we feel safe and the price is right occasionally we get a good flight crew but it is all hit and miss the one consistent thing about turkish airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different
Turkish Airlines,10.0,Zoltan Gal,28th August 2014,BUD-IST-KIX (Istanbul-Osaka) and return. Short range A320 and B737-800 were a bit tighter seated but the A332 on IST-KIX and back was very spacious. We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Smith Amy,28th August 2014,Flew Nairobi-IST-Boston return. While aircraft and cabin were fine food definitely above average and a bird strike was professionally and safely handled by the pilot (take off aborted switch to new aircraft) I was not happy with the following: 1) Very difficult to get hold of Turkish Airlines office by phone. I wanted to inquire about changes to my ticket. In Nairobi I had to end up making the journey to their downtown office in person because no one answered the phone. In the US it was equally difficult to get hold of anyone who could help with ticket changes. You can also only pay any change fees in person at the airport (this alone took an hour prior to the actual check in and ended up being USD 80 higher than originally advised). In Boston there is also no on- line check in available. Turkish is just not equipped with the kind of services that makes this much easier with airlines like KLM BA Delta etc. 2) Horrible experience at Istanbul airport. Again wanted to go to a ticket office to inquire about changes during my layover. In the entire international transit area there is none! It was also incredibly difficult just to find someone who spoke adequate English! After going in circles I was finally told I need to get a visa exit the airport go to the ticket office outside then re-enter! It was also by far the dirtiest airport I have been to hardly saw cleaning crews and if I did they were standing around talking rather than working. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew particularly friendly on a four leg trip one flight attendant stood out for trying to be particularly helpful. I had chosen Turkish because at the time it was the cheapest option the few hundred dollars saved were not worth it because of the other hassles gained.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,R James,18th August 2014,Flew IAH-IST in business. Cabin was nicely appointed and comfortable and the inflight entertainment works well. The food and drinks offered were high quality and plentiful except my fish entree was over cooked. The service was awkward. It was a full hour after takeoff before the in flight service was started. Food was prepared in the forward galley and plated in the rear galley which meant there was constant cabin staff traffic between the two galleys making the cabin environment frenetic.

The TK0051 flight landed in Istanbul at about 19.10 h when the scheduled landing time was 18.00 h. Although I rushed to the gate where I arrived at 19.26 it was impossible for me to get the connecting flight which departed at 19.20 sharp. There were at least 6 more passengers in my same situation. Nobody was waiting for us at Istanbul airport to give us assistance no help was offered. We went to the ""customer care counter"" where a Turkish airlines worker simply gave us instructions to go to the transfer desk. After a very long queue a Turkish Airlines employee explained to us that there was no available flight to Madrid that day. We had to get flight TK1857 departing at 7.50 am next day.

Headset cable was broken only one side could be heard. Way back it was worse: Checked in but was not offered an invitation to the lounge so I had to bribe someone to get me that instead of again going through security. Then 75 min departure delay without any notice information etc. which made me miss my connection in Istanbul. The onboard entertainment system was completely off apologies for the technical defect. Not to mention the USB plug for charging the phone. After the 7hr night flight no breakfast or simply a coffee was offered.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Lee Hayward,8th August 2014,Travel agent booked me on a Malaysia Airlines flight which was code shared with Turkish airlines Turkish for first leg from Istanbul to KL then Malaysian from KL to Sydney. Boarded in Istanbul and the check-in staff couldn't have been less helpful. The first person at the check-in counter passed me off onto someone else because of what she called a 'ticket problem' before promptly going on her break. The second person was slightly more helpful up until the point someone came around and told him to go on a break. Then it became too hard to do anything more than check me in onto the Turkish airlines flight. He wouldn't check my bag through to Sydney no real reason given but from previous experience it is possible to check bags through despite different airlines in operation. This meant that once I arrived in KL I had to clear customs pick up my bag and then check back in again. A massive pain and something that wouldn't have been achievable if I had had less than 3 hours between flights.

Had multiple terrible experiences with TK in the last year the most recent of them in July 2014 on the first flight of our honeymoon! Every time I have flown with TK from JFK or BRU the flight was late by more than 90min without any explanation. Leading to a missed connection and being stranded against our will in Istanbul. Each time the in-flight crew assured us the connecting flight would be informed and wait for us. Each time there was no one upon landing to direct us and help us find our connection gate. Each time we missed the connecting by less than 10min after desperately running across the airport to try and make it. Each time the ground staff for luggage collection and transfer/hotel arrangements were unduly rude and totally unhelpful. And the hotel provided for the night was very sub-standard. And each time we had to pay an entry visa that we would otherwise not have had to pay. I have flown a lot of different airlines and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. In the latest occurrence they would not even make a nice gesture to acknowledge the fact they were ruining the first 2 days of our honeymoon.

On my most recent trip I had to skip the meal because I did not have sufficient room over my legs to lower the tray table. Cabin staff were good but ground staff were decidedly a mixed bag in terms of helpfulness. Entertainment consisted of the 1970's-era pop-down screens.

Once in a while you get an old one which makes the flight experience mediocre. The miles program is great but they started reducing the number of miles that can be earned.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,C Wheeler,31st July 2014,Istanbul to Thessaloniki on a morning flight. Boarded the plane. Two crew were working in the J cabin (including senior crew member). Load of J cabin only 6. They handed out the menu for the service before take-off which had hot breakfast choices. After take-off the crew started the service. Without any interaction the crew member came and passed me the tray. Tray consisted of a fruit yoghurt croissant and a selection of cheese. Never asked me if I would like anything to drink or which hot meal choice I would like. I got up to visit the toilet before the seatbelt sign came on. The J cabin toilet was unusable for its respective cabin customers as the crew allowed a Y cabin customer to use the toilet and he threw a whole tree of paper in the toilet. The other crew member asks me finally if I would like to have anything to drink. Asked for a Turkish coffee. After I came out asked a crew member to take my tray. Then comes my coffee. That's when the seatbelt sign came on. Nobody came to secure the cabin before landing. Landed in Thessaloniki. Waited for our luggage on the carousel only to find the priority bags arriving last. At the end of the day a short flight is a showcase of what a long trip can be with them.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,istanbul to thessaloniki on a morning flight boarded the plane two crew were working in the j cabin including senior crew member load of j cabin only they handed out the menu for the service before take-off which had hot breakfast choices after take-off the crew started the service without any interaction the crew member came and passed me the tray tray consisted of a fruit yoghurt croissant and a selection of cheese never asked me if i would like anything to drink or which hot meal choice i would like i got up to visit the toilet before the seatbelt sign came on the j cabin toilet was unusable for its respective cabin customers as the crew allowed a y cabin customer to use the toilet and he threw a whole tree of paper in the toilet the other crew member asks me finally if i would like to have anything to drink asked for a turkish coffee after i came out asked a crew member to take my tray then comes my coffee thats when the seatbelt sign came on nobody came to secure the cabin before landing landed in thessaloniki waited for our luggage on the carousel only to find the priority bags arriving last at the end of the day a short flight is a showcase of what a long trip can be with them
Turkish Airlines,4.0,E Simeone,29th July 2014,BRU-IST-BRU C cabin - check in is unfortunately a mess no priority check in respected staff not interested don't give a damn attitude. Done by Avia Partner. Had to ask twice for a fast track card for arrivals in IST check in staff did not even know they existed. and they have 4 flights to IST daily. Lounge is always full and dirty and am afraid boarding is always a mess even you are flying c class. From wait in lounge to designated gate to last call all of this in less than 10 minutes simply ridiculous. Experienced this many time. Once on board all is different - friendly yet professionals staff with lack of language skills but ok on security and service. Some try to go the extra mile. Only option to IST direct. They need to improve ground staff and boarding skills and attitudes otherwise I would perhaps recommend. IST lounge on Sunday 27/07/14 announcement from no info to go to gate to last call gate closed 15 mins. Too many flights too little doors even if they are remote they have lost it - they need a third airport.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Jean-Pierre Diels,17th July 2014,"JFK-ATH business class round-trip in June (TK0004 & 0001). Departure from JFK was delayed by almost 3 hours as the pilot could not be found. On arrival in Istanbul we had to go the ""transfer desk"" to find a connection to ATH. Said transfer desk has a queue of over 100 people from every conceivable destination and no priority for business class. End result was that we had to sit for 4 hours in the biz-class lounge and watch 2 codeshares fly out before TK. Yes we missed our connecting flight in ATH as well. Return ATH to IST managed to be 2 hours late as well for a 90 minute morning flight. This time we barely made the JFK connection and our ""priority"" luggage was delivered 2 days later.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Z Shotte,13th July 2014,BHX-IST-BKK. July 9 2014. Boeing 737-800: BHX-IST. Very impressed with Turkish Airlines European business class. By far the best of all European carriers for comfort and privacy. It offers a 2-2 configuration with 20' leather recliners with additional foot rest. There is a personal VOD monitor in the arm rest with a wide variety of shows and movies for a 3 hour flight. Flight attendants are very polite and professional. Food catering is of the highest standard to match and surpass other European Carriers like BA KLM or Lufthansa. Airbus A330-300: IST-BKK. The TK business class lounge is very impressive with kids room multiple TV rooms 2 grand pianos and some of the cleanest toilets I have seen at an airport. Lounge provides user friendly lockers to store your belongings. A bit chaotic boarding at IST. The shuttle bus used to take passengers to the aircraft was a bit overcrowded and ground staff seemed a bit disorganised. However after boarding it's all up hill. FAs were very attentive and professional. The personalised chef for the forward cabin was a nice touch. Good selection of food and drinks and the inflight entertainment is more than adequate for the 9 hours and 40 mins. Seats are very comfortable for business class with an exceptional amount of leg room although the seat configuration of 2-2-2 does not provide loads of privacy for a single traveler with the two end seats A and K not giving direct aisle access. Overall Turkish Airlines provides a very good product in business.

My experience with Turkish Airlines is a tale of 2 experiences the flight experience and customer service on the ground. The flights were all very good. Leg room varied. I had adequate legroom on the B737 and A330 but I felt crushed on the B777. The food was tasty and the flight attendants offered good service. My main issue with Turkish Airlines with the customer service on the ground. leading up to my flight I found frequent outages with their US website. Customer service employees in Istanbul were rude and they refused to adhere to their pledge to provide a hotel when the layover is over 10 hours. As it turned out I was one of a few who experienced the same problem.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,A Kleissner,6th July 2014,We flew from Gatwick to Istanbul (return) and Istanbul - Izmir (return). Planes varied - the least good was a workaday Airbus between Istanbul and Izmir (nothing wrong with it though) the best a brand new B737-800 to Gatwick. We flew economy but noted that business class on the latter had excellent seats. All flights flew to time. Food was very good (complete with metal cutlery). Even between Istanbul and Izmir we got an hors d'oeuvre plus a good sandwich and some cake - the crew hardly had time to serve it. All staff polite and helpful. At Izmir we had checked-in online and were shown to a dedicated counter: there is no Bag Drop facility.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Michael Asher,1st July 2014,Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either. But at least I was able to go to the airport shop and buy a can of Coke for TL 1.75!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,5.0,yes,travelling from alanyagazipasa to istanbul via ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in at the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesnt allow it said the young lady on the desk no lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it in fact the turkish airlines printed timetable doesnt even list the flights there i went into the airport shop for a can of coke but at tl decided it was too much of a rip-off no priority boarding so a scramble at the gate flight operated by anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served at ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening but inside i discovered my next sector was delayed and the business class lounge was outside so i could not reach it luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding they made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through full flight and had another sandwich and cake after landing at istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for minutes before a gate was available my luggage was the last up - seems they dont use priority tags at alanya either but at least i was able to go to the airport shop and buy a can of coke for tl !

My flight was delayed from Accra to Istanbul resulting in me missing all my connecting flights including my flight to Barbados from Gatwick.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,M Hashem,25th June 2014,Flew non-stop Houston to Istanbul in Comfort Economy. I had low expectation however it was a pleasant experience. From check-in to boarding the process was well managed. I was greeted with a smile while boarding and found the Comfort Economy area quite spacious. The seats were 2-3-2 with decent cushioning leg room foot rest and in seat IFE. The seats did not allow reclining for a comfortable sleeping position but let's not forget it was $350 more than basic economy fare. Here is the more pleasant part: the cabin crew were full of smiles and were pleasant. No attitude or doing the passengers a favor type behavior. The food service was good and well portioned. I don't get this much polite and pleasant service in business class of major US carriers! The arrival at IST was timely however we parked at a hard stand.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,I Konstantinidis,23rd June 2014,"I have flown with TK a couple of times this year. The majority of flights are disappointing. Most recent flight was on 20 June 2014 from Riyadh (KSA) to Paris (France) via Istanbul. Leg 1: TK141 was delayed (as usual). Flew with an old A321. Very tired and dirty. Business class seat was an economy seat. Most of business class passengers complained about the seats (it was an overnight flight and most of us wanted to sleep - but it was impossible). Crew was ok - nothing exceptional (typical TK). Food was average - I am really wondering why they have the-so called ""Flying-Chef"" on board. Leg 2: TK1821 was delayed as well.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,M Tushishvili,23rd June 2014,I had return flight CDG-TBS-CDG via Istanbul by Turkish last month. The service overall was really excellent. The food was very good nicely presented and tasty. Cabin attendants were professional in all flights nothing to complain about. Seats are ok for a couple of hours flights with the overhead screens and consequently limited entertainment. I have three observations for improvement: 1) The Business lounge in Sabina airport is very unpleasant a box size room with no edible food available. 2) The Ataturk airport (I had it for return flight) was extremely busy and flights are usually delayed for 30-45 minutes. 3) I observed that the light in cabins during the boarding catering (almost two hours) and landing was extremely bright (it is annoying when there is late evening or night flight).

Turkish Airlines,4.0,T Eldem,23rd June 2014,Flew from IST to ESB on A321. The Business class configuration is typical of the European short haul flights with the middle seat left empty. Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money. With some attention to cabin service and improved FA performance this airline can easily maintain its status as Europe's best but has a long way to go to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,yes,flew from ist to esb on a the business class configuration is typical of the european short haul flights with the middle seat left empty legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over economy aircraft was showing its age and as with all tk flights i have been on the air was stuffy and stale flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties good meal service for a short flight there was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks the fas did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service the crews on tk really need to improve their english skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency as well my experience on all of tk flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the fas as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings the flight left late due to congestion at istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful their domestic service is clearly superior to north american and many european carriers and is certainly good value for money with some attention to cabin service and improved fa performance this airline can easily maintain its status as europes best but has a long way to go to compete with asian and middle eastern carriers on long-haul routes

The seats were extremely comfortable compared to other transatlantic flight I took over the year (i.e. Mostly Austrian and Lufthansa). The service was excellent. The staff friendly and the food delicious. The plane seemed to me just out of production and the IFE was much better than what I am used to with Austrian (which I prefer generally for financial reasons).

Was asked to relocate to a different seat than the one pre- assigned in order to accommodate a passenger with physical disability. Ended up in a window seat as no other aisle seats were available. The Purser tried very hard and apologized profusely. A warm approach I am not used to receiving from TK FA's. Cabin as with many TK flights very warm and air stale. Comfortable lie-flat seats with plush blanket and soft pillow. The shell style seats do not offer much storage room and are narrower than other business class seats. Attentive service throughout the flight with FA's frequently checking on passengers. Good meal and wine selection although main course was somewhat tasteless. AVOD system with 20 inch screens and a wide selection of movie and music options although somewhat dated. The highlight of the flight was the free WiFi which is a very nice touch.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,K Svetlana,20th June 2014,TK 0035 IST Ataturk-Montreal June 17 2014. Booking the flight one month in advance: both my travel agent and I tried to secure an exit row seat. I expected to pay for it. The airline was impossible to reach from Canada. At check-in the seat selected by the travel agent was changed to an unacceptable one. A request to upgrade for business cabin was denied. On the ground at Ataturk a long and very slow line-up in the corridor just to enter the gate (an additional security check - we have gone through the passport control as well as the security already). Not a single seat available. The security agents behaved like Canadian immigration officials interrogating people about purposes of their trips but no information was going into computers. Younger people were sitting on the floor older ones standing there with their bags looked tortured already. The plane was jammed full. The seats in Economy were really cramped no legroom (a 10hr flight). Rude FA's and completely devoid of smiles. Dismissive and unhelpful to boot trying to ignore passengers as much as possible.

EN Route from IST-DOH I was the only person in business class and had to ask the captain and 2 female flight attendants to lower their voice they were literally shouting and laughing it was a 00.35 departure so I wanted to sleep they did not dim the lighting. On the return leg DOH-IST I managed some sleep but was woken by the inflight chef snoring in the seat next to me. IST-DUB I slept through the meal service when I woke I tried to get some water but no one came from the bell I went to the galley which was deserted. There were two flight attendants serving economy class someone came from economy class after about 10 minutes to help me. There is no priority boarding for business class. Great lounge in Istanbul.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no,i flew dublin - istanbul - doha - istanbul - dublin business class seats are very uncomfortable with minimal recline think ba club europe crew would rather be at home no eye contact or smile en route from ist-doh i was the only person in business class and had to ask the captain and female flight attendants to lower their voice they were literally shouting and laughing it was a departure so i wanted to sleep they did not dim the lighting on the return leg doh-ist i managed some sleep but was woken by the inflight chef snoring in the seat next to me ist-dub i slept through the meal service when i woke i tried to get some water but no one came from the bell i went to the galley which was deserted there were two flight attendants serving economy class someone came from economy class after about minutes to help me there is no priority boarding for business class great lounge in istanbul
Turkish Airlines,4.0,Graham Thompson,18th June 2014,Flew TK041 from Johannesburg to Istanbul on 12 June. The flight was full and as a result it was one of the most cramped flights I have experienced. Not for the faint hearted. The major issue is the A330's they use on the route are old and tired. The upholstery was worn through and coming apart from the seats. Very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the world's best. There was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front. I don't think I would fly with them again - will probably take the longer route via Dubai. Emirates' seats have far more leg room on the 777's. The service itself was great it was just the planes that were awful!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no,flew tk from johannesburg to istanbul on june the flight was full and as a result it was one of the most cramped flights i have experienced not for the faint hearted the major issue is the as they use on the route are old and tired the upholstery was worn through and coming apart from the seats very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the worlds best there was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front i dont think i would fly with them again - will probably take the longer route via dubai emirates seats have far more leg room on the s the service itself was great it was just the planes that were awful!

Turkish Airlines,9.0,S Boyce,13th June 2014,Flew TK18 Business Class from Toronto to Istanbul on May 6th code share flight with Air Canada where the ticket was slightly less than through Turkish. Departed on-time. The flight crew were superb attentive and bi- lingual. Great selection of Turkish newspapers including English-language editions. During the over-night flight my wife awoke: A flight crew member immediately came to her to see if there was anything she needed. Food was good as were the entertainment selections. The food and drinks were well presented including â€œcandlelight dinner high above the clouds.â€ The bathroom was kept clean through-out the flight the fresh flowers inside and immediately outside were an unexpected touch. Only complaint was the lack of expedited customs upon arrival. Will fly with Turkish again they certainly provided a high quality international flight.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,flew tk business class from toronto to istanbul on may th code share flight with air canada where the ticket was slightly less than through turkish departed on-time the flight crew were superb attentive and bi- lingual great selection of turkish newspapers including english-language editions during the over-night flight my wife awoke a flight crew member immediately came to her to see if there was anything she needed food was good as were the entertainment selections the food and drinks were well presented including candlelight dinner high above the clouds the bathroom was kept clean through-out the flight the fresh flowers inside and immediately outside were an unexpected touch only complaint was the lack of expedited customs upon arrival will fly with turkish again they certainly provided a high quality international flight
Turkish Airlines,5.0,G Dougherty,12th June 2014,Recently flew Istanbul to New York City in Business Class using United Air Miles. Very comfortable seats which allowed a potential good sleep. Food excellent though it took a long time to serve and we all were anxious to sleep it was evening. There were two problems: the restroom was filthy from the beginning of the flight. Floor was sticky trash overflowed the bins and was on the floor. When I told Flight Attendant I don't believe she really understood. She told me to use the restroom in Business Class but this was in Business Class. Second problem was it seemed families with young children (infants and toddlers) were invited to use Business Class as a free upgrade. This was nice for them but having two screaming youngsters for several hours was hard on the rest of the passengers. Turkish Air has a great reputation so this was a disappointing flight. Check the bathroom!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,yes,recently flew istanbul to new york city in business class using united air miles very comfortable seats which allowed a potential good sleep food excellent though it took a long time to serve and we all were anxious to sleep it was evening there were two problems the restroom was filthy from the beginning of the flight floor was sticky trash overflowed the bins and was on the floor when i told flight attendant i dont believe she really understood she told me to use the restroom in business class but this was in business class second problem was it seemed families with young children infants and toddlers were invited to use business class as a free upgrade this was nice for them but having two screaming youngsters for several hours was hard on the rest of the passengers turkish air has a great reputation so this was a disappointing flight check the bathroom!
Turkish Airlines,10.0,Michael Filnhals,10th June 2014,VIE-IST-TLV-IST-HAM: Outbound flight from VIE to IST with A 330-200. Much legroom excellent food freshly squeezed juices and very tasty hot meal. Flight attendants were smiling and friendly and did a great job to complete a full service within 2hrs 45 min. Flight left on time arrived on time in IST. Smooth check-in and boarding in Vienna. Transfer at IST airport very easy. Plenty of shops and restaurants the only downside is that there was no airbridge available for the next flight to TLV. No seats available at the departure gate and very cramped. Flight from IST to TLV was excellent. Brand new A321 with personal TV on each seat. Again FA's very friendly and they served a hot meal in the middle of the night (flight was 1 hour 40 min). Return flight from TLV to IST again a very new plane flight left punctual at Ben Gurion airport FA's smiling and friendly all the time. Again a smooth transfer at IST connection to HAM. Older aircraft from IST to HAM but enough legroom even in Y- class. I have no doubt to recommend this airline. Especially the catering and the onboard meals are fresh and tasty from Turkish Do&CO.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,Karen Adamthwaite,8th June 2014,We flew from Rome to Istanbul business class staff food and aircraft were excellent no complaints on this 3.5 hour flight. We then had a two hour wait for our flight to Hong Kong in premium economy on Turkish Airlines. Again everything was excellent. Only thing I could say they should get their boarding process more efficient. Everyone was seated near the boarding counter (flight full or nearly full) we had been sitting there for an hour a person came in and told everyone to move we thought the gate had changed. No. We were moved outside the door past another counter and then had to line up show our boarding pass which part was torn off and then had to sit back where we were originally. Sat there for an hour. After all passengers were seated back where they were the staff member then proceeded to zap all the boarding passes it seemed like 6 times. Why I don't know that is usually done in one process. We then lined up in lines marked A B C D and then flew to HKG.

Onboard the plane was not clean the supposedly red seats were much more black the carpet was dirty and entertainment system outdated. Flight attendants were rude. The food as usual was quite good.

The staff on the return leg were one of the most hard working I have encountered making up for the poor plane. However the breakfast was served cold and was uneatable. Same meal was served on the IST-LGW leg and we declined it. Security check at IST on the return leg was horrible.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,D Dillard,11th May 2014,While planning a trip to Istanbul we decided on Turkish Airlines mainly due to low fares out of Houston. We booked economy and were a little concerned due to some negative reviews but we have no regrets but do have a few observations. Check in at Houston was fine we decided to upgrade to comfort class at check in there was no offer or signs we just asked. It cost us $350 each for one way but we are glad we did it. Roomy seats nice amenities and good food in comfort class. The in flight entertainment was not so great mostly older movies but we slept just fine. We had concerns about the temperature in flight and yes it was too warm. On our return from IST the check in was chaotic at best.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,D Menn,8th May 2014,This was the first time I've flown Turkish airlines so I wasn't sure what to expect. The flight from Houston to Istanbul was great and flight attendants were fantastic. But the flight from Istanbul to Houston was bizarre. I had to show my ticket stub 4 times to prove I was in the correct area (not just me everyone had to show their ticket stub) and they placed stickers on unoccupied seats so they could tell if someone changed seats. Turkish Airlines apparently has a weird policy of not letting customers upgrade to premium seating when seats are available. They spend way too much time monitoring the empty seats. They really made my trip feel cheap and uncomfortable.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,no,this was the first time ive flown turkish airlines so i wasnt sure what to expect the flight from houston to istanbul was great and flight attendants were fantastic but the flight from istanbul to houston was bizarre i had to show my ticket stub times to prove i was in the correct area not just me everyone had to show their ticket stub and they placed stickers on unoccupied seats so they could tell if someone changed seats turkish airlines apparently has a weird policy of not letting customers upgrade to premium seating when seats are available they spend way too much time monitoring the empty seats they really made my trip feel cheap and uncomfortable
Turkish Airlines,8.0,A Talley,6th May 2014,I read so many bad reviews of Turkish I was a bit sceptical when I boarded. The flights we took were round trip from Houston to Istanbul. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The plane was comfortable with adequate legroom in economy. Very good inflight entertainment system. Food was excellent.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,J Smith,3rd May 2014,Washington Dulles to Istanbul Business Class. I was re-routed from a cancelled flight onto this one and what a nice surprise it turned out to be. The flight arrived on time and the cabin crew were very polite. The service was excellent with on demand entertainment comfortable reclining seats to sleep in and a complimentary meal service. This was not at all like flying with the USA's airlines where the staff are usually brusque and rude and the service generally terrible. I very much recommend Turkish Airlines for long haul business class.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,washington dulles to istanbul business class i was re-routed from a cancelled flight onto this one and what a nice surprise it turned out to be the flight arrived on time and the cabin crew were very polite the service was excellent with on demand entertainment comfortable reclining seats to sleep in and a complimentary meal service this was not at all like flying with the usas airlines where the staff are usually brusque and rude and the service generally terrible i very much recommend turkish airlines for long haul business class
Turkish Airlines,7.0,T Foran,3rd May 2014,IST-YYZ. Pretty much a good experience except that the overhead luggage storage was completely stuffed full as we boarded the aircraft. This created tension and stress as we did not want to store our belongings way down the aisle. We discovered that it was in fact the cabin crew that had plugged the overheads with their personal luggage and not even the crew from our cabin.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Khan Mamun,30th April 2014,Travelled from Birmingham UK to Dhaka Bangladesh via Istanbul the on-going flight was ok. The return flight was not as pleasant the inflight entertainment system was not working. I asked the cabin crew if they could help but they were far too busy.

I travel at least twice every year to India and this has been the best I have encountered.

Flight attendants were very nice to me for all flights. Food was very good! Eggplant stuffed with minced beef was fantastic! JFK-IST and IST-JFK flights had good IFE with many music and movie selections to choose from.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Mark Hall,27th April 2014,Flew MAN-MBA return in April. Both legs to and from MAN-IST were full. The service was great with a full meal and a good selection of drinks for economy. We had Exit row seats and had ample leg room. Full use of the entertainment system on these legs (good for 3.40 hour flight) and a decent selection of films however the games were not much to have. All fights on time and no luggage issues. Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too. Long-haul flight on single aisle 737-900 service good though not quite the same high standard of the MAN-IST leg. On 7 hour flight to MBA only one full meal service thought they could of managed at least another drinks service many passengers went to the galley to get a drink. The return flight (4.00am) an average breakfast was served and sandwich snack before landing same entertainment system. This flight also included flight socks and shades which was a plus. FAs were friendly on the whole (male FAs more so then the female) though not always obliging and scarce once the meal service was over. Overall a really good experience and superior too many other European airlines would not hesitate one bit to flight them again in fact would prefer too - price wise very competitive and even cheaper too. Look forward to flying with them again.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Penola Greg,23rd April 2014,Travelled ESB-IST-LHR and return 2/4/14 and 7/4/14. Both sets of flights and aircraft were satisfactory. Flight between Ankara and Istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences. Sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal. London flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight. Selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because I was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft. It was beef or nothing. Connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating Ataturk airport customs is a long process. The most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules. Many passengers on Turkish Airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers. This occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didn't say a thing on all occasions. This is a very different attitude compared with other airlines. The command of English of the cabin crew and at times the pilots is quite poor also which is surprising for a growing international airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes,travelled esb-ist-lhr and return and both sets of flights and aircraft were satisfactory flight between ankara and istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal london flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because i was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft it was beef or nothing connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating ataturk airport customs is a long process the most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules many passengers on turkish airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers this occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didnt say a thing on all occasions this is a very different attitude compared with other airlines the command of english of the cabin crew and at times the pilots is quite poor also which is surprising for a growing international airline

On the intercontinental segments both the appetizer and the dessert are chosen from a cart laden (truly) with an incredible selection of options. The menu is extensive and provides something for every taste.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,K Grzymski,19th April 2014,TXL-IST-KRT return. With Lufthansa stopping its flights to KRT in January no major European airline flies there anymore. Thus flying from Europe the shortest route one has to take either Turkish Airlines or Egyptair. Since I had good experience with THY in the past I took them once again and have no complaints except for the 50 mins delay on the IST-KRT leg and the fact that they stopped serving alcohol on flights to sharia-law countries such as Sudan. The food was good and seats in the 738 were comfortable providing sufficient legroom even for a 4.10 hrs IST-KRT flight.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Le Jeune,16th April 2014,I fly every 3 weeks on Turkish. Having a good experience is like a game of roulette. Some aircraft's are excellent others very old and shabby. Economy class does what it says on the tin but Business class is generally below the standard of peers. However one thing is constant: the poor level of service. If anything goes wrong or if you have a special request just forget about it and remember this is an emerging airline. Cheap A to B in economy why not?

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Rossini Maitre,13th April 2014,I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,W Gaynor,13th April 2014,I'm a frequent traveler hopping on planes every couple of weeks for U.S. domestic and European travel and my recent experience flying Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to JFK is the worst flight experience I have had. It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me. So on an eleven-hour flight I ended up with no one to chat with. Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight. On pulling out my laptop to do some work I discovered there was not enough room with the seat in front of me to actually open the laptop fully.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,no,im a frequent traveler hopping on planes every couple of weeks for us domestic and european travel and my recent experience flying turkish airlines from istanbul to jfk is the worst flight experience i have had it started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on march th a day that europe moved to daylight saving time but the turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute next a surly person at the turkish airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down on the flight my travel companion and i were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together we repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plusbusiness with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me so on an eleven-hour flight i ended up with no one to chat with finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last to hours of the flight on pulling out my laptop to do some work i discovered there was not enough room with the seat in front of me to actually open the laptop fully

The cabin crew onboard were courteous enough. Onboard entertainment on outward flight was fine. The connecting flights were the ones that caused problems. On our outward journey there was only one hour allowed for us to get to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Dhaka. This one hour is too little. I am 71 years old and I was made to run behind the porter who was young and strong and was running and pushing my wife in a wheelchair through various check points to get us to the connecting flights on time. On the way back it was even worse. This time the time allowed for changeover at Istanbul was 1.5 hrs. The plane arrived late and after a very long wait the plane eventually stopped on one part of the runway. Passengers were bussed away and then the marathon began for them to get to the terminal for connecting flights.

When transferring flights at Istanbul on the return leg queues were dreadful requiring us to go through security again - this needs to be sorted out!

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Z Nazir,1st April 2014,We boarded a flight from Edin to Istanbul on 23/3/14. The cabin was rather small (seating of 2 and 3) and the air- conditioning was rather warm! Seats can be rather cramped if you are on the plus size. No negative comments about the food though. However Istanbul airport was chaotic. Going through passport control took us a good one hour. The next leg of our flight was Istanbul -Kuala Lumpur on a much bigger plane. Again the food was satisfactory. Service was ok and inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies. Nevertheless the cabin temperature was a bit warm. We got a good deal on the tickets (1900 pounds for 5 pax) so I guess I shouldn't complain much.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,we boarded a flight from edin to istanbul on the cabin was rather small seating of and and the air- conditioning was rather warm! seats can be rather cramped if you are on the plus size no negative comments about the food though however istanbul airport was chaotic going through passport control took us a good one hour the next leg of our flight was istanbul -kuala lumpur on a much bigger plane again the food was satisfactory service was ok and inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies nevertheless the cabin temperature was a bit warm we got a good deal on the tickets pounds for pax so i guess i shouldnt complain much
Turkish Airlines,4.0,B Pleterski,1st April 2014,All 4 flights reasonably good (Vienna-Male and back via Istanbul) however mostly unfriendly crew and delays of 2 of 4 flights. The delay as such was not too bad but the frustrating thing was that the pilots gave no information at all to the passengers. Imagine a delay of 1 hour and you sit in the plane and get no information about reason/extent of delay despite begging flight attendants for information. Pilots just did not care about passengers hope it is not the culture of Turkish Airlines. And there are two extremes: no announcements with regard to flight delay but otherwise so many announcements of useless information that passengers really got irritated. I'm sure Turkish Airlines is quite high in the ratio of announcement time versus flying time. Would be good if they reduce the announcement to the extent of other airlines. Please announce/talk less to passengers!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,yes,all flights reasonably good vienna-male and back via istanbul however mostly unfriendly crew and delays of of flights the delay as such was not too bad but the frustrating thing was that the pilots gave no information at all to the passengers imagine a delay of hour and you sit in the plane and get no information about reasonextent of delay despite begging flight attendants for information pilots just did not care about passengers hope it is not the culture of turkish airlines and there are two extremes no announcements with regard to flight delay but otherwise so many announcements of useless information that passengers really got irritated im sure turkish airlines is quite high in the ratio of announcement time versus flying time would be good if they reduce the announcement to the extent of other airlines please announcetalk less to passengers!

Turkish Airlines,9.0,M Brandt,30th March 2014,I flew in business class from Zurich to Johannesburg and back via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Their business class product for short haul was by far the best business class I have experienced in Europe. The crew were friendly and efficient the seat pitch was good and the food was absolutely great. The lounge in Istanbul is one of the nicest business class lounges I have been in. The long-haul sector to Johannesburg and back was also great. OK the seat and the inflight entertainment and not the most modern but they were well within acceptable bounds.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,A Pagan,28th March 2014,IST-JIB with return. Both sectors brand new A321 with very good IFE. Food always above standards and plenty of soft drinks (no spirits on these flights). Cabin crew very attentive. The outbound leg arrived 30 minutes early. However the return had a delay of 30 minutes and I had a connection flight to catch (1h 30 min). This is the biggest issue with THY. Ground handling in IST. Although they were informed they did nothing. Long bus ride and then the chaotic security control of IST airport. The only reason that I didn't miss the next flight was a 20 minute delay.

On our journey back we missed our flight due to a faulty flight display system which did not show that the plane was boarding and a public announcement system which did not announce the flight.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,M Slabbinck,27th March 2014,I flew TK1939 (IST-BRU) in an Airbus 321. I had forgotten how pleasant flying economy class could be after all those hated Ryanair flights. Every seat has a personal screen with loads of movies to chose from. Fortunately the 3 hour flight gave me enough time to watch a full movie. Food was delicious. They even brought a menu with a choice of two plates. Wine was free. There even was a cook (complete with a cook hat). I know -it's just a flight attendant dressed differently but I bought it. Being a Gold elite member at Star Alliance I had access to the Turkish Airlines lounge before the flight. Truly wonderful. Spacious a great buffet and even a golf simulator to kill time.

Service is good however you might encounter a little attitude at times from the flight attendants. The departure back to IAD on flight #7 was also quite nice with some attitude problems from some flight attendants.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,R Deu,17th March 2014,BCN-IST-LJU in economy 7 March 2014. One of the better flights on Turkish. What bothers me is the inconstancy of service staff and maintenance of flight. 1 good flight out of 10. I always select a seat when booking but somehow when I check in TK always change the seat. As a Gold member I am not able to select exit rows either not even at online check-in. On both flights I was comfortable however having an aisle seat the middle sear next to me was empty the cabin was not hot at this time and the service was rather good.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,Adam Wang,17th March 2014,London-Istanbul-Beijing Economy class. I have to say this is the best economy class I have experienced. For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways. I feel sorry for the cabin crews as there are just so many people and there are little things the crews could do about it.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,london-istanbul-beijing economy class i have to say this is the best economy class i have experienced for both segments turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other european airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice for the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class however the drawback is the geography of turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline however i have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways i feel sorry for the cabin crews as there are just so many people and there are little things the crews could do about it

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Charlotte Mathiassen,11th March 2014,Copenhagen-Istanbul-Kathmandu on 18th February and back on 24th and that was not a good experience. On the flight from Istanbul to Kathmandu the plane was old and shabby with very little space the lights at the seats did not work so the light was on in the cabin all night there were no screens in front of the seats and no entertainment not even information on the flight on the small communal screens. Nobody served water or anything during the night dinner was OK but meagre and as a vegetarian I got only half the food of those who had ordered meat. I asked for more but the staff member never came back with it. The flight could not land in Kathmandu due to fog. We were 5 hours late with an extra landing in New Delhi with no food or drink and arrived 5 hours late with no offer of compensation. On the way back again more than 5 hours delay without information as to why as we arrived in Istanbul it took ages to get tickets for a meal in the airport and when we got them we could only use them in the fast food restaurants in the food court and had to pay ourselves if we wanted to sit in a decent place.

TK turned out to be very good on all four sectors: all flights on time or ahead of schedule all aircraft quite new with great legroom and good IFE that had many interesting options. Moreover the hot meals by DO&CO were of high quality compared to any big European competitor - I still prefer proper food on flights over 3 hrs instead of a sandwich if a meal is served. Human interaction is always a matter of personal taste: for us the cabin crews on these full flights were perfectly fine with good command of English - plus many smiles all the way.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,J Nilsson,7th March 2014,We chose the airline for the good price they have in Business Class and also for the fantastic lounge in Istanbul. The hard product on long distance planes are great but the 737 and 320 that we flew ARN-IST with is just normal economy seats with blocked middle seat. The food is good but the service level is low. Priority boarding is a big no. Everyone is let onboard straight away. The Cabin Crew hardly says hello as you enter the aircraft and dinner service is slow. A smile is very unusual on Turkish. So pay for a good seat (on long distance flights) ok food onboard and a good lounge in Istanbul. Service level is very low.

This was a very bad experience you had to go through security control and I had only a limited time for connection. It was overcrowded and disorganized. We started with delays because of disorganization. They checked whether everybody had a visa or permission to go to a Schengen country. Why did they not check it when getting the boarding pass. Entering the plane very unfriendly crew. They served everything without smiles not speaking English?

This was followed by drinks and meal. JFK-IST served 2 meals and IST-BOM had one. Leg room for economy was pretty much what I expected. IFE was quite good. New movies shows and free WIFI which was of course slow but worked. They also have USB media so you could just snap your flash drive and it will play the songs / media on it. I have travelled on Cathay Qatar and Emirates and while they do have the USB slot it wouldn't play media but this one did. Staff were courteous and polite. The IST-JFK sector had many vacant seats in Comfort class but they wanted 260 Euros which I didn't got for. Paid less than $900 for the round trip with the stopover so it was a good value.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,flew jfk-bom and return with stopover in ist on my way back first served a little turkish delight lokum which was quite nice this was followed by drinks and meal jfk-ist served meals and ist-bom had one leg room for economy was pretty much what i expected ife was quite good new movies shows and free wifi which was of course slow but worked they also have usb media so you could just snap your flash drive and it will play the songs media on it i have travelled on cathay qatar and emirates and while they do have the usb slot it wouldnt play media but this one did staff were courteous and polite the ist-jfk sector had many vacant seats in comfort class but they wanted euros which i didnt got for paid less than for the round trip with the stopover so it was a good value

Turkish Airlines,8.0,M Fischer,26th February 2014,HAM-IST-AYT-IST-HAM: Once onboard we were greeted by courteous staff. Before takeoff they served Turkish Delight in economy class which is something never to be seen on any other European airlines. They even arranged my vegetarian meal from business class as it was not loaded. TK serves fresh orange juice and lemonade which is perhaps the best drink I have had on onboard! Meals are always tasty and crew are friendly and helpful although I have to say that Chef-onboard service is absolutely useless. Chef did not even know what the vegetarian meal was on TK flights but thanks to the crew who got me something to eat although it came an hour after the service. The legspace is acceptable and much better than Air Berlin and Lufthansa though one of their aircraft's was so old that I could hold the seat cushion. All in all it was a pleasant experience.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Sandro Pentimalli,25th February 2014,I flew with Turkish in January in C-Class Vienna-Istanbul-Bangkok and Singapore-Istanbul-Vienna. Its true that they offer good amounts of food but the quality was poor on all these sectors. Completely tasteless meals served by flight attendants that did not smile at all and did not understand English. The cabins of the long sectors IST- BKK and SIN-IST were also quite dirty. The most disappointing thing was that the crews on all the sectors were not very friendly.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Anders Pedersen,21st February 2014,JNB-IST-WAW 13 and 14th Feb. Flights on time. Metal was A330 and A321 respectively. The long haul was excellent with many food and drink choices. Wines from 4-5 continents ranging from rose champagne red and whites selected from within a wide range just to my taste. FA attendants were frequent and respectful. IFE maybe the best I've seen and easy to operate. Huge monitors. Bed not fully lie flat so I actually turned around and laid my head on the stool and slept better with my legs in slight upward position. Night-kit given was boring and superfluous. Check-in at transit in JNB only possible 3 hours prior to departure. However was allowed through security without boarding cards as to kill time in the SAA-lounges. When the check in lady eventually appeared at transit she was professional and kind and managed even to trace my luggage and give it an additional (needed) label so I could transfer it throughout. The corresponding luggage receipt was smoothly given to me as I entered the stairs boarding the aircraft. The lounge in IST was extended with a huge under-deck 3 days ago and is a world-class positive experience in design space beauty and service provided. IST-WAW on Airbus 321-200. Not business class seat but ordinary economy with tabled middle seat to increase space in the 3x3 configuration. IFE on small ceiling monitors were useless. Staff were alert and kind. As usual for TK one was dressed up pretending to be a cook despite we were only 4 pax in business out of 12 possible.

Leg room a disaster compared to other TK a/c. Again all female crew friendly nice food. I also noticed that on all 4 flights the aircraft's were never air-conditioned.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,E Igor,13th February 2014,IST-EZE GRU-IST Economy. I am a frequent flyer with TK (Elite) and there are many things I like about TK but the biggest problem of this airline is consistency. Some flights are excellent while others are just a horrible experience. This happened with my flights to EZE and back from GRU. The plane on both legs was awful. Under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom. Overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of. It had not been cleaned properly before departure. The staff were not attentive forgetting my requests. On the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice. The temperature during the flight - freezing. The lounge in GRU is a joke. The good TAM lounge is closed at night and they use the Smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable. Ground handling poor - my priority has not been recognized at baggage delivery and for the return flight the check in staff didn't attach the priority label at all. All in all if I only took this one flight and judged TK based on this experience I would definitely not recommend this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,no,ist-eze gru-ist economy i am a frequent flyer with tk elite and there are many things i like about tk but the biggest problem of this airline is consistency some flights are excellent while others are just a horrible experience this happened with my flights to eze and back from gru the plane on both legs was awful under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of it had not been cleaned properly before departure the staff were not attentive forgetting my requests on the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice the temperature during the flight - freezing the lounge in gru is a joke the good tam lounge is closed at night and they use the smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable ground handling poor - my priority has not been recognized at baggage delivery and for the return flight the check in staff didnt attach the priority label at all all in all if i only took this one flight and judged tk based on this experience i would definitely not recommend this airline
Turkish Airlines,1.0,M Gregory,12th February 2014,9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail. This completely ruined the flight for me whilst I respect that the airline couldn't bump someone from a pre booked seat we should have been sat together by default at point of booking.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,th feb tk we purchased our tickets from london to istanbul and then from istanbul on to hong kong almost as soon as they were released months before we were due to travel perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point we didnt worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early this turned out to be a naive assumption! when we attempted to check in online which was more than hours before the istanbul to hong kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin our pleas to the turkish airlines office in london the check in desk at gatwick and the transfer desk at istanbul were all to no avail this completely ruined the flight for me whilst i respect that the airline couldnt bump someone from a pre booked seat we should have been sat together by default at point of booking

No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental. As a regular flyer on THY in recent years I would recommend changing the meals a little - on all 4 flights food was the same as before always delicious but perhaps a little tired compared to some years ago. Beverage service excellent and although staff of THY are not very smiley they were effective. Inflight entertainment good with good selection of movies both older and recently published.

On my first leg I ordered a glass of water twice but it never came I had to walk to the galley to get my glass of water. The food was served after 1 hour. It was an 8.5 hrs flight so me and my wife slept a bit after the meal was done. I took beef biriyani and my wife took grilled chicken. The chicken was really tasty unfortunately I choose the wrong meal. Then before landing we were served a sandwich which was good. On our 2nd leg IST to JFK (10 hrs 30 mins) it was an early morning flight which was supposed to take off at 7.30 but got delayed 45 minutes. First meal (scrambled egg with mushroom) was served immediately after take off which was tasty but the cabin crews were again disappointing.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Risat Haque,3rd February 2014,Flew from Manchester to Dhaka (14th January) return Dhaka to London (11th January). Completely mixed bag experience when comparing the outbound and return journeys. The outbound was 10 out 10 due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc. I took advantage of the free Istanbul Tour offered by the Turkish Airlines. For the return leg the flight was delayed by 7.5 hours due to foggy conditions at Dhaka which obviously is not Turkish's fault. I was put on a different connecting flight to London which was supposed to depart within 1 hour of the arrival of the Dhaka flight to Istanbul. However the flight took 8.5 hours instead of 7 hours which meant that I missed the London flight. But what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this 8.5 hour flight. If Turkish is to compete with the other Airlines (Emirates Qatar Etihad) flying to Dhaka it has to take the Istanbul-Dhaka-Istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,yes,flew from manchester to dhaka th january return dhaka to london th january completely mixed bag experience when comparing the outbound and return journeys the outbound was out due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc i took advantage of the free istanbul tour offered by the turkish airlines for the return leg the flight was delayed by hours due to foggy conditions at dhaka which obviously is not turkishs fault i was put on a different connecting flight to london which was supposed to depart within hour of the arrival of the dhaka flight to istanbul however the flight took hours instead of hours which meant that i missed the london flight but what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this hour flight if turkish is to compete with the other airlines emirates qatar etihad flying to dhaka it has to take the istanbul-dhaka-istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights

Plenty of food and snacks on the long haul flight - I love how they give out Turkish Delights just after take off and a meal menu on all flights.

When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,B Duston,28th January 2014,"JFK-Istanbul-Bangkok. While the crew were not overwhelmingly friendly they did their jobs efficiently and mostly with smiles. What sets Turkish Airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the Istanbul Airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board. Whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps 3 different appetizers to choose from on Turkish Airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different Turkish appetizers from you to select. You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from. The seats on both flights were not of the ""lie flat"" variety but were comfortable nonetheless. My only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature. The crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights. I did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to Istanbul which she did. But in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again. Offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights. Lastly it really is a bit comical to see one or two of the flight attendants dressed up as chefs given that none of the food is prepared on board.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,4.0,yes,jfk-istanbul-bangkok while the crew were not overwhelmingly friendly they did their jobs efficiently and mostly with smiles what sets turkish airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the istanbul airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps different appetizers to choose from on turkish airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different turkish appetizers from you to select you can try as many as you want the same logic holds true for desserts you had perhaps different options to choose from the seats on both flights were not of the lie flat variety but were comfortable nonetheless my only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature the crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights i did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to istanbul which she did but in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights lastly it really is a bit comical to see one or two of the flight attendants dressed up as chefs given that none of the food is prepared on board
Turkish Airlines,2.0,Richard Daniels,25th January 2014,TK 713 Dhaka - Istanbul Dec 13 2013 and TK 712 Istanbul - Dhaka Jan 9 2014. The airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their Dhaka bound flights. Now they are using their oldest A330-203 with no inflight entertainment at all. Seats are sometimes broken. Even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying. FAs are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this. They will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping. When I got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in Istanbul (5 hours away). Dhaka is not an easy destination but Turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger. In winter when there is morning fog in Dhaka Turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like Emirates or Qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by 5 hours without prior notification. It had now happened 3 times travelling from Dhaka or Istanbul. Only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy. Nevertheless this was my last flight with them after I was a loyal traveller due to affordable price.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,no,tk dhaka - istanbul dec and tk istanbul - dhaka jan the airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their dhaka bound flights now they are using their oldest a- with no inflight entertainment at all seats are sometimes broken even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying fas are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this they will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping when i got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in istanbul hours away dhaka is not an easy destination but turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger in winter when there is morning fog in dhaka turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like emirates or qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by hours without prior notification it had now happened times travelling from dhaka or istanbul only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy nevertheless this was my last flight with them after i was a loyal traveller due to affordable price
Turkish Airlines,3.0,Anders Pedersen,23rd January 2014,BKK-SGN. Very disappointed upon a first good impression that did not last: Aircraft 777-300 were old and worn. Staff pretend to be kind but were just assuming they could speak English. Basically no food on board and a very very poor cold sandwiched was made from remnants from the previous leg flown. Horrible. The 2 staff dressed as cooks were a joke: apart from clothes not clean they were just pretending and no foods were ever cooked or made for the flight. Could not get additional food. They told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip. An FA agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again. The mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much. After hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance. Menu cards were wishful thinking. Seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view. No earphones provided. No travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! Seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safety/emergency info card. Staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer. At least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies. We were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon. That gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food. I was allowed to try their ancient 1st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with 4 windows at a seat. The cabin was closed for service however as only business class is sold. Give only score 3 out of 10: two for being on time and one for an FA for being honest enough to admit food crises on board.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,bkk-sgn very disappointed upon a first good impression that did not last aircraft - were old and worn staff pretend to be kind but were just assuming they could speak english basically no food on board and a very very poor cold sandwiched was made from remnants from the previous leg flown horrible the staff dressed as cooks were a joke apart from clothes not clean they were just pretending and no foods were ever cooked or made for the flight could not get additional food they told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip an fa agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again the mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much after hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance menu cards were wishful thinking seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view no earphones provided no travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safetyemergency info card staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer at least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies we were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon that gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food i was allowed to try their ancient st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with windows at a seat the cabin was closed for service however as only business class is sold give only score out of two for being on time and one for an fa for being honest enough to admit food crises on board

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Stephan Schilling,22nd January 2014,On Jan 17th we went from DXB to IST. This flight was awful. Normally they have quite a lot space in economy class but not in this Boeing we really had to squeeze ourselves between the seat rows! Also they had no control over the hand luggage. Passengers came with really large bags and cases which that were not at all suitable to be stored in the cabin. When the lockers were full some passengers started arguing. This was chaos! Until this point we had always been satisfied with THY but this time we were disappointed. The connecting flight from IST to LEJ as well as the onward flights some days ago were much better.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,on jan th we went from dxb to ist this flight was awful normally they have quite a lot space in economy class but not in this boeing we really had to squeeze ourselves between the seat rows! also they had no control over the hand luggage passengers came with really large bags and cases which that were not at all suitable to be stored in the cabin when the lockers were full some passengers started arguing this was chaos! until this point we had always been satisfied with thy but this time we were disappointed the connecting flight from ist to lej as well as the onward flights some days ago were much better
Turkish Airlines,2.0,Lange Michael,22nd January 2014,Flight from MUC to IST. We left on time but when we reached IST we had to wait about 25 mins on the airfield. The crew were very unfriendly without saying 'hello' on entering the plane. Shortly after take off we got Turkish Delights then nothing more for 1.5 hrs.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,E Mciver,20th January 2014,LHR-IST-LHR over the Christmas - We use this airline regularly as they offer a good choice of flights from London with convenient departure times and have always been impressed with the quality of inflight service. B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777. Overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many Western European airlines that I have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes,lhr-ist-lhr over the christmas - we use this airline regularly as they offer a good choice of flights from london with convenient departure times and have always been impressed with the quality of inflight service b- in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new very tasty meals were served in both directions and the turkish delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch good choice of drinks offered with the meal although its true to say that they dont regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley to be honest there arent many airlines that do these days - especially in economy all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! the avod offered a good choice of tv and movies - the h flight passed very quickly its worth remembering however that some of the flights from london use smaller b or a family aircraft and may not have personal tvs in economy the and flights from lhr generally use as s we have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many western european airlines that i have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them

Safety instructions from staff before landing sound more like army orders. The media box in their A340 takes half of the foot space absolutely inconvenient on long distance.

Furthermore very limited language options on some flights only. The food was very good on one flight average on 2 and un-enjoyable on the 4th flight. Journey time was quite long.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,A Al-Ani,13th January 2014,Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,4.0,no,although seats are very good there are severe limitations istanbul airport offers no extra tracks for business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the nightearly in the morning usually to pass the overcrowded security checks there is a fast track lane but it was always closed when i needed to pass it times in the past months istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of tk this means that your expensive business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep tk assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely for instance while flying from istanbul to cape town tk started serving dinner at midnight for over hours then they wake you up hours before landing to serve breakfast even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours the hours flight to cape town thus had only hours of quite sleeping time worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry another bad example was the flight from istanbul to doha here same procedure although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off midnight again food was served almost the entire flight hours noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous during the flight to doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers no curtain and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates the staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist

Turkish Airlines,,Mark Evans,8th January 2014,London Heathrow to Odessa (Ukraine) return. The only positive was that the leg room is actually fairly decent. However: Online check in is a time consuming and laborious process. It is a completely pointless exercise as we had to queue for almost an hour to have the ground crew re-check us in for the flight and take our bags. Staff both on the ground and in the air were surly and miserable. My seat on the flight from LHR-IST was broken and did not lock in any position which was deeply uncomfortable. On the same flight my partner's TV was broken and did not work at all. It took the flight crew almost 1 hour 40 minutes to serve a drink. Transfer arrangements in Istanbul can only be described as a complete and utter shambles. No clear directions people everywhere being funnelled into a small security check area. On the way home we were told to go and join another random queue for a further passport check. Whilst at the gate in IST the flight to Odessa was delayed by an hour with no staff whatsoever in sight.

The plane food service were all way below what I expected the plane was so old I was surprised it was still in service. I took a return trip from New Delhi to Rome - via Istanbul. At that time I raved to friends about the quality of the plane flight everything. I was shocked when my experience this year was so bad. Staff didn't want to be on the plane it was so bad.

Turkish Airlines,,Sabeen Obaidullah,8th January 2014,I took a business class flight from London to Karachi via Istanbul leaving on 15th December 2013 and returning on 4th January 2014. Going in December the London to Istanbul leg was on par with the business class for other carriers I had flown with both in terms of the seats and the service. For the Istanbul to Karachi leg (5 hours) the seats were essentially comparable to economy class seats for other airlines I have taken (e.g Emirates Qatar Airways Oman Air) both in terms of width and maximum pitch. This was the case for the entire return journey both from Karachi to Istanbul and from Istanbul to London. Essentially I feel as if I have paid for a business class ticket but received economy class seats! I certainly wasn't feeling refreshed after a holiday to go straight back to work. I would not advise anyone to use Turkish Airlines.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no,i took a business class flight from london to karachi via istanbul leaving on th december and returning on th january going in december the london to istanbul leg was on par with the business class for other carriers i had flown with both in terms of the seats and the service for the istanbul to karachi leg hours the seats were essentially comparable to economy class seats for other airlines i have taken eg emirates qatar airways oman air both in terms of width and maximum pitch this was the case for the entire return journey both from karachi to istanbul and from istanbul to london essentially i feel as if i have paid for a business class ticket but received economy class seats! i certainly wasnt feeling refreshed after a holiday to go straight back to work i would not advise anyone to use turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines,,Mark Evans,8th January 2014,London Heathrow to Odessa (Ukraine) return. The only positive was that the leg room is actually fairly decent. However: Online check in is a time consuming and laborious process. It is a completely pointless exercise as we had to queue for almost an hour to have the ground crew re-check us in for the flight and take our bags. Staff both on the ground and in the air were surly and miserable. My seat on the flight from LHR-IST was broken and did not lock in any position which was deeply uncomfortable. On the same flight my partner's TV was broken and did not work at all. It took the flight crew almost 1 hour 40 minutes to serve a drink. Transfer arrangements in Istanbul can only be described as a complete and utter shambles. No clear directions people everywhere being funnelled into a small security check area. On the way home we were told to go and join another random queue for a further passport check. Whilst at the gate in IST the flight to Odessa was delayed by an hour with no staff whatsoever in sight.

Having read several reviews particularly around the level of business class service we were somewhat apprehensive prior to travelling. In the event we found the overall product to be high quality and at an operational level all flights departed on time and allowed connections to be made easily. It is true that its down to you to request drinks throughout the flight but requests were met in a friendly way. In fact there was certainly no lack of friendliness or smiles from the cabin crew unlike other reviews on this site.

Each sector was on time and operated by an aircraft with decent legroom. Meals on board were excellent more bistro than airline food! Transiting at Istanbul airport is as painful as getting through packed Gulf hubs (as Doha and Abu Dhabi) but this is the unavoidable part of the journey! Just two cons: Most of cabin crew and ground staff at IST have really basic English skills. In Dec 2013 online check-in was not available at KL airport making the pre-flight experience a bit hectic.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,J Xue,2nd January 2014,IST to Gatwick London on 25th as a Gold member with other Star Alliance airlines they did not provide a priority baggage handling tag. Lounge at IST was excellent but far too busy at least 10 mins to find a seat and another 10 mins to queue for the foods. If you want to have a shower you may need to wait 90 mins. From London to Istanbul on 30th I was not allowed to use the lounge not allowed to increase check-in baggage allowance and could not check my bags to my final destination. When I re-checked my bags in Istanbul they would not check-in my bag again to Melbourne only to Singapore asked me to re-check them in Singapore. After I arrived in Singapore I checked with ground staff of Singapore airlines who helped me to re-direct my bags to Melbourne and I did not have to do it myself again.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,A England,12th December 2013,IST-HKG. I am afraid Turkish Airlines is slipping. The check in and immigration lines at the Istanbul airport are lengthy and bureaucratic. I was pleased with the overnight travel kit. The food was average but the drinks were plentiful. There were films TV series and music selections but the choices were limited and dated. The touch screens cannot be fully navigated from the remote so the passenger behind me was pecking at my seat repeatedly. The plane was dated and rather warm. No one was using their blankets. Finally the service was rushed and English and Chinese were limited. The English announcements were comical.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,no,ist-hkg i am afraid turkish airlines is slipping the check in and immigration lines at the istanbul airport are lengthy and bureaucratic i was pleased with the overnight travel kit the food was average but the drinks were plentiful there were films tv series and music selections but the choices were limited and dated the touch screens cannot be fully navigated from the remote so the passenger behind me was pecking at my seat repeatedly the plane was dated and rather warm no one was using their blankets finally the service was rushed and english and chinese were limited the english announcements were comical

Flew A330 from ORD-IST in the business class cabin and was very pleased with the excellent service and food. Lay-flat seats were very comfortable.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,O Vuorenmaa,10th December 2013,We flew Helsinki-Istanbul-Kigali and Mombasa-Istanbul-Helsinki recently. The online booking and check-in was easy the website is very user friendly (no OLCI at Mombasa though). The planes on HEL-IST-HEL were Airbus equipment one older and one new with state-of-the-art entertainment system. The older one had only overhead screens showing flight tracking only. The seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom. On African sectors brand new B 737-900ER were used. These planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies. I must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes I ever flown with. On all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when I last could select my meals from menu card in economy class. The cabin service was professional and friendly. Some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off. All flights arrived on-time and bags delivered. As all flights were normal I cannot comment how the problem situations are handled. For us the round- trip was perfect and I have no hesitation to use Turkish again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,we flew helsinki-istanbul-kigali and mombasa-istanbul-helsinki recently the online booking and check-in was easy the website is very user friendly no olci at mombasa though the planes on hel-ist-hel were airbus equipment one older and one new with state-of-the-art entertainment system the older one had only overhead screens showing flight tracking only the seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom on african sectors brand new b -er were used these planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies i must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes i ever flown with on all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when i last could select my meals from menu card in economy class the cabin service was professional and friendly some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off all flights arrived on-time and bags delivered as all flights were normal i cannot comment how the problem situations are handled for us the round- trip was perfect and i have no hesitation to use turkish again

We were on an older A330 on the KUL-IST segment and a newer 777 on the IST-IAH segment. As several people have mentioned however the temperature in both planes were far too warm compared to other flights I've been on. Flight attendants were ok.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,S Aksoy,9th December 2013,Istanbul-Los Angeles / New York-Istanbul. Mixed feelings for Comfort Class. Free wireless and live TV (only 4 channels though) clearly made the 14 hours of flying more tolerable. However we didn't have those on the return flight even though it was the same plane- 777-300. Service and catering have been great on both flights. Seat comfort however was below average since it's impossible to sleep with its angle. Despite other airlines premium passengers don't get separate check-in desk and lounge access. It also common to see economy passengers sneaking into comfort class and take the empty seats throughout the flight!,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,yes,istanbul-los angeles new york-istanbul mixed feelings for comfort class free wireless and live tv only channels though clearly made the hours of flying more tolerable however we didnt have those on the return flight even though it was the same plane- - service and catering have been great on both flights seat comfort however was below average since its impossible to sleep with its angle despite other airlines premium passengers dont get separate check-in desk and lounge access it also common to see economy passengers sneaking into comfort class and take the empty seats throughout the flight!
Turkish Airlines,7.0,M Yong,9th December 2013,MAN-IST-ICN. First time flying with Turkish Airlines. Booked my flights in June and travelled in December. Itinerary showed B739 and B773 but ended up flying in B738 and A340. The B738 was old and there was overhead screen for entertainment for MAN-IST a 4 hour flight. My seat's earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed. IST-ICN flight entertainment was good but limited choices. Amenities were given on the IST-ICN flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers. The cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airline's where the cabin would be cold. Food was tasty but not delicious. Service was average. Rarely notice any drink rounds on the 10 hour flight but they provided a bottle of water after meal. Witnessed a cabin crew just switched off a passenger's call button and walked away even before the passenger manage to speak. Overall Turkish Airlines was not as good as I expect from a top 10 airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,man-ist-icn first time flying with turkish airlines booked my flights in june and travelled in december itinerary showed b and b but ended up flying in b and a the b was old and there was overhead screen for entertainment for man-ist a hour flight my seats earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed ist-icn flight entertainment was good but limited choices amenities were given on the ist-icn flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers the cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airlines where the cabin would be cold food was tasty but not delicious service was average rarely notice any drink rounds on the hour flight but they provided a bottle of water after meal witnessed a cabin crew just switched off a passengers call button and walked away even before the passenger manage to speak overall turkish airlines was not as good as i expect from a top airline
Turkish Airlines,8.0,Selim Yalvac,9th December 2013,Overall the flight from IST-IAH was very comfortable. The leg room and the comfort class seats were very comfortable. The only criticism I have is that the flight attendants never walk around for drink refills. For wine enthusiasts like I am this means you have to constantly ask for refills.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,D Graubard,9th December 2013,FCO-IST-ADS-IST-BCN over a 4 day period early December. A320 or 737 aircraft - all in decent shape. Seat comfort is fine and on the 737s the leg room was larger then some premium economy flights I've been on. Where Turkish excels is the food - quality and quantity beat any airline hands-down and I've travelled on over a hundred airlines. Flight attendants were friendly and all spoke English well. On-time or within 10 minutes of schedule - Ataturk Airport is a mess and all flights arrived or departed via gate stand so dealing with buses to and from the planes gets annoying. Overall for the money paid Turkish gives a good product. Again - as stated by many people- they keep their planes too warm. I wouldn't fly them on anything longer then 4 hours.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,fco-ist-ads-ist-bcn over a day period early december a or aircraft - all in decent shape seat comfort is fine and on the s the leg room was larger then some premium economy flights ive been on where turkish excels is the food - quality and quantity beat any airline hands-down and ive travelled on over a hundred airlines flight attendants were friendly and all spoke english well on-time or within minutes of schedule - ataturk airport is a mess and all flights arrived or departed via gate stand so dealing with buses to and from the planes gets annoying overall for the money paid turkish gives a good product again - as stated by many people- they keep their planes too warm i wouldnt fly them on anything longer then hours

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Shriram Gadekar,6th December 2013,I recently has 2 horrible experiences with this airline on my DC-Istanbul-Mumbai and Mumbai-Istanbul-Chicago flights. On my flight from Washington DC-Istanbul I received sub standard service from one of the air hostesses. Even after 4 requests I did not get any headsets. I was served dinner late and without any bread. The air hostess plainly ignored my request for coffee. While coming back from Mumbai-Istanbul I had booked row 29 seats but when I checked in I was given row 46 boarding passes that were not window seats. For window seats she offered me row 53 inflight row 53 was indeed the last row and I couldn't do anything. The food quality was not at all good and asking a preferred (Vegetarian or Special) meal doesn't make any difference. I will never fly Turkish again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no,i recently has horrible experiences with this airline on my dc-istanbul-mumbai and mumbai-istanbul-chicago flights on my flight from washington dc-istanbul i received sub standard service from one of the air hostesses even after requests i did not get any headsets i was served dinner late and without any bread the air hostess plainly ignored my request for coffee while coming back from mumbai-istanbul i had booked row seats but when i checked in i was given row boarding passes that were not window seats for window seats she offered me row inflight row was indeed the last row and i couldnt do anything the food quality was not at all good and asking a preferred vegetarian or special meal doesnt make any difference i will never fly turkish again
Turkish Airlines,,H Ikwue,6th December 2013,I was flying from Dublin to Lagos with stopover at Istanbul. Dublin ground staff were exceptional but once I got on the flight everything went sour. Firstly the Dublin to Istanbul flight had no in-flight entertainment. At Istanbul it was near impossible finding an English speaking ground staff. Arranging accommodation was a nightmare because of the language barrier. After that was eventually sort getting to the hotel was so embarrassing as there was no wheelchair accessible cabs and the Turkish airlines staff were unwilling to help me into the bus so I had to be carried into the bus by 2 of the other passengers. And had to suffer the same humiliation for the drive back to the airport.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,A Ala-JÃ¤Ã¤ski,4th December 2013,"This was my first time on Turkish Airlines (Helsinki-Istanbul-Helsinki). The plane was ok I liked the leather seats and there was enough space for me. The seats seemed a bit ""worn out "" to me though. The plane could have been tidier I guess it had just brought passengers to Helsinki and there was only a little time to clean it. The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues. I have also got used to cabin crew paying attention to seat belt sign during turbulent weather but they just let people move around and use toilets normally.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,this was my first time on turkish airlines helsinki-istanbul-helsinki the plane was ok i liked the leather seats and there was enough space for me the seats seemed a bit worn out to me though the plane could have been tidier i guess it had just brought passengers to helsinki and there was only a little time to clean it the toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners planes which was nice food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! they showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system this problem affected all the passengers not just me the flight attendant couldnt do anything about this problem what really upset me was the cabin crews attitude on safety matters flight attendants didnt care at all about the position of passengers seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing it definitely didnt give a good impression of safety issues i have also got used to cabin crew paying attention to seat belt sign during turbulent weather but they just let people move around and use toilets normally

Although it is a short flight sitting 3+ hours in the their A320 seats is a torture the pitch must have been adjusted by the millimetre to squeeze in one or two more rows. Seats are hard and although I am of average height my knees toughed the front seat. The crew were as previously experienced on THY dull and not particularly friendly. Smiles are rare unfortunately.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Altaf Shaheda,27th November 2013,Whereas they claim to be Europe's best airline their ground services are appalling. My flight TK60 on 19 November to Kuala Lumpur was supposed to have left at 00.55 was delayed 6 hours. I landed in Istanbul at 22.20 from Germany to avail of the connecting flight. It was a nightmare to be stuck in Istanbul airport to face their most unprofessional and rude ground staff. A meal voucher was handed to me around 2.00 as though they were doing me a big favor.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,D Stanley,29th October 2013,London to Dhaka via Istanbul twice in the last month. Usually I have a good experience with Turkish. However this time it was not so great. The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved.

Staff told me it was my problem. Said I had to negotiate seat moves onboard. Departure gate staff appear to be contracted out so don't really care. Not sure why they are part of Star Alliance as they don't seem to care about Star Alliance patrons either.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Pinhas Yusuf,29th October 2013,I flew Turkish a couple of times in the past months and the most conspicuous feature was the seats lacking the adjustable headrest often the lack of the footrest and the lack of personal in-flight entertainment.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,C Watson,20th October 2013,"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Rahman Mehtab,18th October 2013,LHR-IST-DAC. LHR-IST in cramped A320 rushed and poor service with cabin crew having very poor English skills. Crew forgot to serve our row and when this was pointed out was shown palm as she was 'busy' and would deal with it when she had time. Finally got meal served 45 minutes later than other passengers. On arrival at Istanbul TK ground staff showed indifference to questions asked about the complimentary 'TourIstanbul' offer for long transits indicating I would have to find out at my own initiative if I could avail it and that they would not be able to provide any advise! Ataturk Airport is busy but has a good selection of duty free and some nice lounges. IST-DAC on leased Meridiana Aircraft. Terrible flight poor service. However flight departed on time and arrived early. I had no in-seat entertainment console/remote as it had been ripped off its place I assume hence was unable to view inflight entertainment - did not miss much it was only 5 channels of not-so-new movies. Cabin crew were lax with security and the service was very poor. TK takes pride in their 'Turkish Hospitality' but I found the hospitality of theirs quite poor to be truthful.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,Schmittinger Gerd,18th October 2013,My decision to fly this time with Turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers: Stuttgart via Istanbul to Cape Town and back. I was pleasantly surprised! The service at the counter was very professional and friendly. No long queues. No hassle with a bag being slightly too thick (having to be re-packed as done at other airlines) and an allowance of 30kg checked in baggage great. Unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes Airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked. The food and refreshments excellent! Service good. What a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in Istanbul in Euros. My only advisory comment is that Turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult (or rude) customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these. I will definitely fly Turkish again and highly recommend it.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,my decision to fly this time with turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers stuttgart via istanbul to cape town and back i was pleasantly surprised! the service at the counter was very professional and friendly no long queues no hassle with a bag being slightly too thick having to be re-packed as done at other airlines and an allowance of kg checked in baggage great unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked the food and refreshments excellent! service good what a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in istanbul in euros my only advisory comment is that turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult or rude customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these i will definitely fly turkish again and highly recommend it

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Tapani Vuola,18th October 2013,HEL-IST-HEL. I was impressed the short check in both ways the planes boarded left and arrived in time the luggage was quickly delivered (in Istanbul already when reaching the belt).

Turkish Airlines,,D Parker,18th October 2013,My wife and I flew from Istanbul to Abu Dhabi on flight TK 0868 on Thur 17 Oct 2013. It had been a great holiday but the flight out was a real let down. For inexplicable reasons our seats were in a hot zone in the plane and we felt like we were being subjected to some sort of in-flight sauna! We did ask the flight attendant (twice in fact) if she could let the flight engineer know of our discomfort. Nothing changed and our four hour flight was awful (not helped by the fact that my wife already felt under the weather). The staff member to whom we reported the fault appeared genuinely sympathetic but although the rear seats in the plane did get cooler we sweltered the whole trip. I think Turkey's a great place and would like to visit it again - but I will not travel on Turkish airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no,my wife and i flew from istanbul to abu dhabi on flight tk on thur oct it had been a great holiday but the flight out was a real let down for inexplicable reasons our seats were in a hot zone in the plane and we felt like we were being subjected to some sort of in-flight sauna! we did ask the flight attendant twice in fact if she could let the flight engineer know of our discomfort nothing changed and our four hour flight was awful not helped by the fact that my wife already felt under the weather the staff member to whom we reported the fault appeared genuinely sympathetic but although the rear seats in the plane did get cooler we sweltered the whole trip i think turkeys a great place and would like to visit it again - but i will not travel on turkish airlines again

Turkish Airlines,7.0,S Adams,15th October 2013,Our family of five adults recently traveled from Los Angeles (LAX) to IST to DAR and back. The new lounge in IST is gorgeous! The LAX-IST legs were excellent: comfortable seats attentive staff good food. The IST-DAR legs were only fair: seat controls didn't work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre. But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes. Very frustrating! Finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes,our family of five adults recently traveled from los angeles lax to ist to dar and back the new lounge in ist is gorgeous! the lax-ist legs were excellent comfortable seats attentive staff good food the ist-dar legs were only fair seat controls didnt work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre but the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system even though i had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in by using the electronic ticket numbers and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didnt exist the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes very frustrating! finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board
Turkish Airlines,10.0,A Christner,15th October 2013,I flew Turkish Airlines for the first time recently and was very impressed. I just flew shorter flights between Athens and Istanbul and Izmir and Istanbul but found the cabin crew to be professional and gracious and even on a one hour regional flight still received a meal of a whole grain roll with cheese green lettuce and tomato with some yoghurt as well. After flying United with its deathly pale iceberg lettuce and overcooked food on a long flight it was really refreshing! Maybe I was on the newer planes but they were so clean and with individual screens even on shorter flights.

Turkish Airlines,,J Tsabar,13th October 2013,TLV to IAH - totally different experience than the outbound trip two weeks earlier. TLV to IST took off 45 minutes late. A group of us (16 people) with a 1 hour IST connection to the IST-IAH flight were assured we will make our flight (as we were earlier told by the agent after buying the ticket). Upon landing in IST we were gathered and made to run across the terminal to our IST-IAH fanlight only to find out someone probably forgot to ask for this flight to be held for us (despite what we were told). The flight was already in the air. Lots of confusion and lack of initiative led to a 3 hours fiasco before we were rescheduled for the next day's flight. We were taken to a hotel (Radisson). Kosher food was not available and food that was provided was poor at best. Next day flight IST to IAH took off 3 hours late while we were sitting in the cabin with no food or drinks (see previous posts - same experience). Food on the return leg was not as good as on the outbound leg. Bottom line - not sure all the above was worth the troubles. I will have to think long and hard before flying with THY again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,no,tlv to iah - totally different experience than the outbound trip two weeks earlier tlv to ist took off minutes late a group of us people with a hour ist connection to the ist-iah flight were assured we will make our flight as we were earlier told by the agent after buying the ticket upon landing in ist we were gathered and made to run across the terminal to our ist-iah fanlight only to find out someone probably forgot to ask for this flight to be held for us despite what we were told the flight was already in the air lots of confusion and lack of initiative led to a hours fiasco before we were rescheduled for the next days flight we were taken to a hotel radisson kosher food was not available and food that was provided was poor at best next day flight ist to iah took off hours late while we were sitting in the cabin with no food or drinks see previous posts - same experience food on the return leg was not as good as on the outbound leg bottom line - not sure all the above was worth the troubles i will have to think long and hard before flying with thy again

Got to plane with 5 mins to spare got seated and had 3 seats to myself. Just before take off captain announces a big delay and everyone had to get off. He said LHR was fog bound so a 2 hrs delay so back to departure lounge where 3 members of staff proceeded to shout out passenger names to the 200+ passengers so we could retrieve our boarding passes. This was chaos and very unprofessional. 2.5 hr wait then back on the plane where another 150 passengers appeared from nowhere to fill all seats then another 1 hour wait on the tarmac with no explanations before take off - total 3.5 hours delay with no food or drinks.

Turkish Airlines,,S Green,9th October 2013,"LOS-IST-TLV. One word: Terrible. B737-900 LOS-IST. No air conditioning at LOS airport and drinks are not allowed into gate. By the time you board most passengers are very thirsty. Requests for water were shrugged off with the response ""later"". How can you refuse water to thirsty passengers. After take off painfully slow dinner service and a small plastic cup with water served. Of course it's not enough. Again FA would not supply more water. I even went to the galley pointed at a full bottle of water and asked for some. Again I was told to return to my seat water will come later. I approached the inflight manager to complain and situation improved. Poor English by pilots and FA's couldn't understand any announcements. No soap in toilets with nothing to dry wet hands on. Smiles from the crew were out of the question. Food was ordinary can't understand where all the fuss about their food in Economy class comes from. Maybe from flights outside Africa.

My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Alan Dhana,1st October 2013,I flew business class from CGK-IST-AMS overall it was a great experience but unfortunately it was not very memorable. The seat itself was great and comfortable the cabin layout was modern and clean however I found out that the cabin crew seemed to be inconsistent. They did not really interact with the passengers less smiles and seemed to lack manners. On the other side indeed there were the dedicated cabin crew who were willing to care and serve the passengers.

Cape Town to Istanbul Istanbul to Paris London Gatwick to Istanbul and Istanbul back to Cape Town. All flights were on time or early. The planes were reasonably new clean and comfortable. The flight back to Cape Town was completely full but even that wasn't uncomfortable. The staff were always helpful and polite. The seats are reasonably comfortable with good pitch - my gripe is the foot rest which isn't convenient if you are tall and gets in the way when folded up. The entertainment system is varied and the screens large (no individual screens on the plane from Gatwick). Food was plentiful and tasty. And there are a few extras - a substantial amenity kit - sometimes in a tin. Slippers and a Turkish delight as a welcome sweet.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Ross Algie,17th September 2013,We flew economy from Bangkok to HCMC (Saigon). The cabin was the dirtiest I've encountered. When I opened the tray table there was vegetable matter there gravy had dripped down the seat as well as what looked like cola. The floor hadn't been cleaned as there were food scraps along the floor mounts. No IFE at all. Food was a dismal chicken and cheese sandwich and a slice of cake. One of the exit lamps was playing up so the attendant whacked it with her hand - to no avail. Cabin crew were inattentive and appeared bored. This flight originated in Istanbul and flew to HCMC via Bangkok. Perhaps the crew didn't change in BKK? The plane was an older 777-300 and the seats looked like they needed a good scrub. By comparison the business class seats looked good.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Gary Schoberl,15th September 2013,Flew TK071 HKG-IST on 29/08/2013. There was a delay of 30 mins or so no explanation from crews. Inflight entertainment and the food was superb. However the cabin crew were so unfriendly and they disappeared after the first service. No water or beverages offering during the flight until next service (breakfast) 2.5 hours before landing. I won't be travelling with Turkish Airlines until they improve their customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,no,flew tk hkg-ist on there was a delay of mins or so no explanation from crews inflight entertainment and the food was superb however the cabin crew were so unfriendly and they disappeared after the first service no water or beverages offering during the flight until next service breakfast hours before landing i wont be travelling with turkish airlines until they improve their customer service
Turkish Airlines,2.0,Mustafa Kemal,12th September 2013,My first TK A330-300 trip my first Y experience on TK for a long time. The plane was full. I have never seen speciality meals delivered through the same door the pax were boarding very unprofessional. FA asking the gate agents to check some luggage (gate check) they had no idea how to deal with it. I have never seen giant garbage bags piled up at the doors during the flight as if there was no place to store it. Never seen one of the chefs coming off from his rest in a t-shirt carrying his uniform in his hand. It was chaotic for the whole flight constant shuttling of food trays bags drinks back and forth. Slow inattentive service. Good luck to the cleaning crew to turn it around on time. On the plus side most of the front lavatories were larger than I'm used to Thanks to the inflight entertainment iphone and my noise cancelling headphones I was happy. The Y seats were not comfortable for me for the 10.40 hrs flight. I hope I never have to do that again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,no,my first tk a- trip my first y experience on tk for a long time the plane was full i have never seen speciality meals delivered through the same door the pax were boarding very unprofessional fa asking the gate agents to check some luggage gate check they had no idea how to deal with it i have never seen giant garbage bags piled up at the doors during the flight as if there was no place to store it never seen one of the chefs coming off from his rest in a t-shirt carrying his uniform in his hand it was chaotic for the whole flight constant shuttling of food trays bags drinks back and forth slow inattentive service good luck to the cleaning crew to turn it around on time on the plus side most of the front lavatories were larger than im used to thanks to the inflight entertainment iphone and my noise cancelling headphones i was happy the y seats were not comfortable for me for the hrs flight i hope i never have to do that again
Turkish Airlines,2.0,Holstein Hans-JÃ¼rgen,12th September 2013,My wife and I had a Business Class trip from Istanbul to Hamburg on 9th September. My seat was 01D. The backrest kept moving in rest position and could only be brought back manually after 5 min. The safety belt with the lock was twisted by 180 degrees and could not be refitted on the plane. The stewardess just told me to take another seat. The luggage marked with the priority label arrived on the conveyor belt approx after 50% of all suitcases. These small faults shows me that this Airline is not consistent in the quality of their technical standards. After this trip I asked myself how this Airline deals with bigger technical problems. I cannot recommend it.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,,,2.0,no,my wife and i had a business class trip from istanbul to hamburg on th september my seat was d the backrest kept moving in rest position and could only be brought back manually after min the safety belt with the lock was twisted by degrees and could not be refitted on the plane the stewardess just told me to take another seat the luggage marked with the priority label arrived on the conveyor belt approx after of all suitcases these small faults shows me that this airline is not consistent in the quality of their technical standards after this trip i asked myself how this airline deals with bigger technical problems i cannot recommend it
Turkish Airlines,,Taskin Chowdhury,12th September 2013,The return flight was overbooked hence they put us on a flight 7 hours later. They promised food vouchers but we never got them so ended up buying our own thing. When we were given boarding passes 2 out of 3 of them were hand written which was refused by the immigration officer after 1 hour of queuing. Had to go back to the airline desk and staff behaved as if it was our fault. when they issued printed boarding passes now they changed our seats to the back of the plane! When we eventually boarded the crew again shifted us to other seats. Offered a meal but they only had beef! I asked for a child pack and they did not have that either. Then I asked for a pillow / blanket for my baby which I was refused and stated that there were none.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,the return flight was overbooked hence they put us on a flight hours later they promised food vouchers but we never got them so ended up buying our own thing when we were given boarding passes out of of them were hand written which was refused by the immigration officer after hour of queuing had to go back to the airline desk and staff behaved as if it was our fault when they issued printed boarding passes now they changed our seats to the back of the plane! when we eventually boarded the crew again shifted us to other seats offered a meal but they only had beef! i asked for a child pack and they did not have that either then i asked for a pillow blanket for my baby which i was refused and stated that there were none
Turkish Airlines,5.0,Cem Ozgenoglu,9th September 2013,London to Istanbul 16/08/13 flight TK1980. 2 out of my last 3 flights were delayed. One for 6 hrs on a 3.5 hrs flight and another 1.15 hrs on 50 min flight. There is lack of information and communication from ground staff and poor customer relations. I find food to be average. Never had any problems with cabin crew as they are very professional. I think Turkish Airlines expanded its fleet and destinations too much too soon and now cannot manage it properly.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,no,london to istanbul flight tk out of my last flights were delayed one for hrs on a hrs flight and another hrs on min flight there is lack of information and communication from ground staff and poor customer relations i find food to be average never had any problems with cabin crew as they are very professional i think turkish airlines expanded its fleet and destinations too much too soon and now cannot manage it properly

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Sargeant Alan,2nd September 2013,Istanbul - Odessa. Flight was full but left and landed on time. Cabin crew were good and managed to serve a reasonable meal on this short flight.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,S Han,28th August 2013,Singapore to Dublin via Istanbul and return Dublin to Singapore also via Istanbul. Appreciate the night kit that they provide on the overnight flight from Istanbul to Singapore. It was in a metal box which is sort of nice and could be a collector's item. First time that I had received such a nice night kit for an overnight flight. Food was good. IFE was reasonably good though films are not the latest. Cabin crew was kept busy as their flights are full on all the four sectors. Turkish Airlines must be doing something right to be attracting some many customers. A consequence of the full flight was the toilets were not cleaned and one was choked throughout the flight back to Singapore without anyone clearing it. Overall a nice experience with THY.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,singapore to dublin via istanbul and return dublin to singapore also via istanbul appreciate the night kit that they provide on the overnight flight from istanbul to singapore it was in a metal box which is sort of nice and could be a collectors item first time that i had received such a nice night kit for an overnight flight food was good ife was reasonably good though films are not the latest cabin crew was kept busy as their flights are full on all the four sectors turkish airlines must be doing something right to be attracting some many customers a consequence of the full flight was the toilets were not cleaned and one was choked throughout the flight back to singapore without anyone clearing it overall a nice experience with thy

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Hashim Azlan,27th August 2013,I had an excellent team of cabin crew on TK1053 to Zagreb on the 21st of August. They were really friendly and warm during the flight. The cold sandwich plus cheese and crackers on 2 hours flight was practical and the portion was good too. The drinks selection was impressive. In general cabin and toilets were in a good condition when knowing it was an older version of an Airbus A320.
